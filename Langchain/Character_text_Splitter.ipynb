    "# Difference between CharacterTextSplitter and RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\n",
    "\n",
    "The **CharacterTextSplitter** and **RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter** are both used to split large text into smaller chunks, but they differ in their approach and how they handle the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. CharacterTextSplitter\n",
    "- **Approach**: The **CharacterTextSplitter** splits text purely based on a fixed character length. It does not consider the structure or meaning of the text, and simply cuts the text into chunks of a predefined maximum number of characters.\n",
    "- **Use case**: This is useful when you need simple, fixed-length chunks, but it may result in splitting in the middle of sentences or words.\n",
    "- **Example**: If you set the chunk size to 100 characters, the text will be split every 100 characters, even if that means cutting off in the middle of a word.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "Text: *\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "If the chunk size is 10 characters, the output might be:\n",
    "- \"The quick \"\n",
    "- \"brown fox \"\n",
    "- \"jumps over\"\n",
    "- \" the lazy \"\n",
    "- \"dog.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\n",
    "- **Approach**: The **RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter** uses a more sophisticated, recursive approach. It first attempts to split the text by a certain character length but then tries to refine the splits by considering the structure of the text (like sentence boundaries or paragraph breaks). This splitter is more context-aware and tries to avoid splitting in the middle of sentences or words.\n",
    "- **Use case**: This is useful when you want to preserve the integrity of the text, such as avoiding cuts in the middle of sentences or paragraphs.\n",
    "- **Example**: If the chunk size is set to 100 characters, the splitter will first try to break the text every 100 characters, but if the split happens in the middle of a sentence, it will adjust to make the cut at a more logical boundary (e.g., the end of a sentence).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "Text: *\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. It is a nice day outside.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "If the chunk size is set to 50 characters, the output might be:\n",
    "- \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy\"\n",
    "- \"dog. It is a nice day outside.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the **RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter** avoids splitting in the middle of a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Differences:\n",
    "- **CharacterTextSplitter**: Splits strictly by character count, which may result in unnatural breaks within words or sentences.\n",
    "- **RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter**: Splits text more intelligently, considering sentence or paragraph boundaries to preserve meaning and readability while still managing chunk sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the **RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter** provides a more context-aware splitting method, while the **CharacterTextSplitter** is a simpler approach based purely on character count.\n"
