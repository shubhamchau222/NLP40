This new report shows the other side of alcohol:  the lives its \\nharmful use claims, the diseases it triggers, the violence and injuries it causes, and the \\npain and suffering endured as a result. \\nThis report presents a comprehensive picture of how harmful alcohol use impacts \\npopulation health, and identiﬁes the best ways to protect and promote the health and \\nwell-being of people. \\nIt also shows the levels and patterns of alcohol consumption worldwide, the health and \\nsocial consequences of harmful alcohol use, and how countries are working to reduce \\nthis burden.\\nWhile less than half of the world’s adults have consumed alcohol in the last 12 months, the \\nglobal burden of disease caused by its harmful use is enormous. Disturbingly, it exceeds \\nthose caused by many other risk factors and diseases high on the global health agenda. \\nOver 200 health conditions are linked to harmful alcohol use, ranging from liver diseases, \\nroad injuries and violence, to cancers, cardiovascular diseases, suicides, tuberculosis and \\nHIV/AIDS. \\nAlthough the highest levels of alcohol consumption are in Europe, Africa bears the heaviest \\nburden of disease and injury attributed to alcohol. \\nThe report ﬁnds that while inaction on alcohol control is widespread, there is also hope. For \\nexample, political commitment at the highest level to implement effective interventions \\nhas contributed substantially to the sharp reduction of alcohol use and related harm in \\neastern Europe. \\nThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to provide a more equitable and \\nsustainable future for all people by 2030, ensuring that no one is left behind. While the \\nagenda’s goals have health targets on substance abuse and addressing noncommunicable \\ndiseases, reducing alcohol-related harm also increases the chances of reaching other \\ntargets.  \\nMaintaining the momentum towards the SDGs is only possible if countries demonstrate \\nthe political will and capacity to meet the different targets. Countries have committed to \\nbring about change as part of the Global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol and \\nthe WHO Global action plan for the prevention and control of NCDs 2013–2020.  \\nNow the task we share is to help countries put in place policies that make a real and \\nmeasurable difference in people’s lives. \\nWe have no time to waste; it is time to deliver on alcohol control.\\nDr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus \\nDirector-General\\nWorld Health Organization\\n'),\n",

REDUCING THE HARMFUL USE OF ALCOHOL:  \\nA KEYSTONE IN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT\\n• \\nThe harmful use of alcohol is one of the leading risk factors for population health \\nworldwide and has a direct impact on many health-related targets of the Sustainable \\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs), including those for maternal and child health, infectious \\ndiseases (HIV, viral hepatitis, tuberculosis), noncommunicable diseases and mental \\nhealth, injuries and poisonings. Alcohol production and consumption is highly relevant \\nto many other goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. \\nAlcohol per capita consumption per year in litres of pure alcohol is one of two \\nindicators for SDG health target 3.5 – “Strengthen the prevention and treatment of \\nsubstance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse and harmful use of alcohol”.  \\n• \\nAlcohol frequently strengthens inequalities between and within countries, hindering \\nthe achievement of SDG 10 which calls for inequalities to be reduced. Harms from \\na given amount of drinking are higher for poorer drinkers and their families than for \\nricher drinkers. This pattern of greater “harm per litre” is found for many different \\nharms caused by alcohol. \\n• \\nEconomic development from a poorer society to a richer one may have potential in the \\nlonger term to mitigate alcohol-related harm, but more immediately it can bring about \\nan increase in alcohol consumption and related harm as the availability of alcoholic \\nbeverages increases. Effective alcohol control measures in the interests of public \\nhealth are especially important when rapid economic development is under way.  \\n• \\nAlcohol is often consumed before, along with, or after other psychoactive substance \\nuse, and the comorbidity of alcohol and tobacco dependence is strong and well \\ndocumented. Public health policies, strategies and interventions should take into \\naccount the frequent association of alcohol consumption with the use of other \\npsychoactive substances, particularly with opioids and benzodiazepines – for \\nprevention of overdose deaths – and with cannabis – for road safety. \\nCHAPTER 2. GLOBAL STRATEGIES, ACTION PLANS AND \\nMONITORING FRAMEWORKS\\n• \\nThe harmful use of alcohol is mentioned in numerous global strategies and action \\nplans, but WHO’s Global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol continues to \\nbe the most comprehensive international policy document providing guidance on \\nreducing the harmful use of alcohol at all levels.\\n• \\nWith development and ratiﬁcation of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, \\nalcohol remains the only psychoactive and dependence-producing substance with \\nsigniﬁcant global impact on population health that is not controlled at the international \\nlevel by legally-binding regulatory frameworks. \\n'),\n",

The most cost-effective actions, or “best buys”, include increasing taxes \\non alcoholic beverages, enacting and enforcing bans or comprehensive restrictions \\non exposure to alcohol advertising across multiple types of media, and enacting and \\nenforcing restrictions on the physical availability of retailed alcohol. \\n• \\nThe growing evidence of a contributing role of harmful use of alcohol to the disease \\nburden of infectious diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, viral hepatitis and sexually \\ntransmitted infections has not yet been sufﬁciently recognized and addressed in the \\nrelevant global strategies and action plans. \\n• \\nThere has been a signiﬁcantly increased demand for global information on alcohol \\nconsumption, alcohol-attributable harms and policy responses. WHO’s Global \\nInformation System on Alcohol and Health (GISAH) is a global repository for all key \\nalcohol-related indicators included in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \\nand in global monitoring frameworks for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs).\\n• \\nMonitoring and surveillance systems on alcohol and public health should cover \\nthree overall domains of key indicators, namely those on alcohol consumption, \\nhealth and social consequences, and policy and programme responses. International \\ncomparability of data generated by countries is essential for global monitoring. \\nAssessment and monitoring of unrecorded alcohol consumption continues to be a \\nchallenge for national monitoring systems.\\nCHAPTER 3. ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION\\n• \\nWorldwide in 2016, more than half (57%, or 3.1 billion people) of the global population \\naged 15 years and over had abstained from drinking alcohol in the previous 12 months. \\nSome 2.3 billion people are current drinkers. Alcohol is consumed by more than half of \\nthe population in only three WHO regions – the Americas, Europe and Western Paciﬁc.\\n• \\nIn the African, Americas, Eastern Mediterranean and European regions, the percentage \\nof drinkers has declined since 2000. However, it increased in the Western Paciﬁc \\nRegion from 51.5% in 2000 to 53.8% today and has remained stable in the South-\\nEast Asia Region.\\n• \\nTotal alcohol per capita consumption in the world’s population over 15 years of age \\nrose from 5.5 litres of pure alcohol in 2005 to 6.4 litres in 2010 and was still at the \\nlevel of 6.4 litres in 2016. The highest levels of per capita alcohol consumption are \\nobserved in countries of the WHO European Region. \\n• \\nWhereas in the WHO African Region, the Region of the Americas and the Eastern \\nMediterranean Region alcohol per capita consumption remained rather stable, in \\nthe European Region it decreased from 12.3 litres in 2005 to 9.8 litres in 2016. The \\nincrease in per capita alcohol consumption is observed in the WHO Western Paciﬁc \\nand South-East Asia regions.\\n• \\nCurrent drinkers consume on average 32.8 grams of pure alcohol per day, and this is \\nsome 20% higher (40.0 g/day) in the African Region and about 20% lower (26.3 g/day) \\n'),\n",

Drinkers increased their alcohol consumption since \\n2000 in almost all regions except the WHO European Region. \\n• \\nOne quarter (25.5%) of all alcohol consumed worldwide is in the form of unrecorded \\nalcohol – i.e. alcohol that is not accounted for in national ofﬁcial statistics on alcohol \\ntaxation or sales as it is usually produced, distributed and sold outside the formal \\nchannels under governmental control. \\n• \\nWorldwide, 44.8% of total recorded alcohol is consumed in the form of spirits. The \\nsecond most consumed type of beverage is beer (34.3%) followed by wine (11.7%). \\nWorldwide there have been only minor changes in beverage preferences since \\n2010. The largest changes took place in Europe, where the share of total recorded \\nconsumption of spirits decreased by 3% whereas that of wine and beer increased. \\n• \\nPrevalence of heavy episodic drinking (HED) (deﬁned as 60 or more grams of pure \\nalcohol on at least one occasion at least once per month) has decreased globally from \\n22.6% in 2000 to 18.2% in 2016 among the total population, but remains high among \\ndrinkers, particularly in parts of Eastern Europe and in some sub-Saharan African \\ncountries (over 60% among current drinkers). \\n• \\nWorldwide, more than a quarter (26.5%) of all 15–19-year-olds are current drinkers, \\namounting to 155 million adolescents. Prevalence rates of current drinking are highest \\namong 15–19-year-olds in the WHO European Region (43.8%), followed by the Region \\nof the Americas (38.2%) and the Western Paciﬁc Region (37.9%). \\n• \\nResults of school surveys indicate that in many countries of the Americas, Europe and \\nWestern Paciﬁc alcohol use starts before the age of 15 years and prevalence of alcohol \\nuse among 15-year-old students can be in the range of 50–70% with remarkably small \\ndifferences between boys and girls. \\n• \\nWorldwide and in all WHO regions, prevalence of HED is lower among adolescents \\n(15–19 years) than in the total population but it peaks at the age of 20–24 years when \\nit becomes higher than in the total population. Except for the Eastern Mediterranean \\nRegion, all HED prevalence rates among drinkers of 15–24 years are higher than in the \\ntotal population. Young people of 15–24 years, when they are current drinkers, often \\ndrink in heavy drinking sessions. Prevalence of HED is particularly high among men. \\n• \\nIn all WHO regions, females are less often current drinkers than males, and when \\nwomen drink, they drink less than men. Worldwide, the prevalence of women's \\ndrinking went down in most regions of the world, except in the South-East Asia and \\nWestern Paciﬁc Regions, but the absolute number of currently-drinking women has \\nincreased in the world.\\n• \\nThe economic wealth of countries is associated with higher alcohol consumption and \\nhigher prevalence of current drinkers across all WHO regions.

HEALTH CONSEQUENCES\\n• \\nIn 2016, the harmful use of alcohol resulted in some 3 million deaths (5.3% of all \\ndeaths) worldwide and 132.6 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) – i.e. 5.1% \\nof all DALYs in that year. Mortality resulting from alcohol consumption is higher than \\nthat caused by diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and diabetes. Among men \\nin 2016, an estimated 2.3 million deaths and 106.5 million DALYs were attributable to \\nthe consumption of alcohol. Women experienced 0.7 million deaths and 26.1 million \\nDALYs attributable to alcohol consumption.\\n• \\nThe age-standardized alcohol-attributable burden of disease and injury was highest in \\nthe WHO African Region whereas the proportions of all deaths and DALYs attributable \\nto alcohol consumption were highest in the WHO European Region (10.1% of all \\ndeaths and 10.8% of all DALYs) followed by the Region of the Americas (5.5% of \\ndeaths and 6.7% of DALYs).\\n• \\nIn 2016, of all deaths attributable to alcohol consumption worldwide, 28.7% were due \\nto injuries, 21.3% due to digestive diseases, 19% due to cardiovascular diseases, \\n12.9% due to infectious diseases and 12.6% due to cancers. About 49% of alcohol-\\nattributable DALYs are due to noncommunicable and mental health conditions, and \\nabout 40% are due to injuries. \\n• \\nWorldwide, alcohol was responsible for 7.2% of all premature (among persons \\n69 years of age and younger) mortality in 2016. People of younger ages were \\ndisproportionately affected by alcohol compared to older persons, and 13.5% of all \\ndeaths among those who are 20–39 years of age are attributed to alcohol. \\n• \\nAlcohol caused an estimated 0.4 million of the 11 million deaths globally in 2016 \\nwhich resulted from communicable, maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions, \\nrepresenting 3.5% of these deaths. \\n• \\nHarmful use of alcohol caused some 1.7 million deaths from noncommunicable \\ndiseases in 2016, including some 1.2 million deaths from digestive and cardiovascular \\ndiseases (0.6 million for each condition) and 0.4 million deaths from cancers. Globally \\nan estimated 0.9 million injury deaths were attributable to alcohol, including around \\n370 000 deaths due to road injuries, 150 000 due to self-harm and around 90 000 \\ndue to interpersonal violence. Of the road trafﬁc injuries, 187 000 alcohol-attributable \\ndeaths were among people other than drivers. \\n• \\nIn 2016 the leading contributors to the burden of alcohol-attributable deaths and DALYs \\namong men were injuries, digestive diseases and alcohol use disorders, whereas \\namong women the leading contributors were cardiovascular diseases, digestive \\ndiseases and injuries. \\n'),\n",

ALCOHOL POLICY AND INTERVENTIONS \\n• \\nIn 2016, 80 countries reported having written national alcohol policies, while a further \\neight countries had subnational policies and 11 others had a total ban on alcohol. The \\npercentage of countries with a written national alcohol policy steadily increased from \\n2008, and many countries have revised their policies since the Global strategy to \\nreduce the harmful use of alcohol was released. The majority of countries in Africa and \\nthe Americas do not have written national alcohol policies. The presence of national \\nalcohol policies is highest among reporting high-income countries (67%) and lowest \\namong low-income countries (15%). Principal responsibility for the policy lies with \\nthe health sector in 69% of countries with a national policy. \\n• \\nLevels of treatment coverage for alcohol dependence (calculated as the proportion of \\nalcohol-dependent persons who are in contact with treatment services) varied widely \\nin 2016 from close to zero in low- or lower-middle-income countries to relatively high \\n(more than 40%) in high-income countries. Results of the survey indicate that the \\nlevel of treatment coverage in most countries is not known. About half of reporting \\ncountries indicated that they increased the level of screening and brief interventions \\nfor hazardous and harmful drinking in primary health care settings since 2010, but most \\nof this progress was conﬁned to high-income and upper-middle-income countries. \\n• \\nThe majority (97) of responding countries have a maximum permissible blood alcohol \\nconcentration (BAC) limit to prevent drink–driving at or below 0.05%. However, 37 \\nresponding countries have a BAC limit of 0.08%, and 31 responding countries have \\nno BAC limits at all. Seventy countries (41%) reported using sobriety checkpoints and \\nrandom breath-testing as prevention strategies, but 37 (22%) used neither strategy. \\nThe number of countries reporting these measures increased substantially between \\n2008 and 2016. \\n• \\nLicensing systems are the commonest means of restricting alcohol availability, and 47 \\ncountries have a licensing system along with a government monopoly in at least one \\nlevel of the alcohol market. Of the countries with an alcohol licensing system, most \\nreported an increase in the number of licences to distribute and sell alcohol, particularly \\nin the African and South-East Asia regions. Two in every ﬁve countries reported growth \\nin the number of licences to produce alcohol. Increases in the number of licences for \\nalcohol production and distribution is concentrated in low-income countries. \\n'),\n",

Thirty-ﬁve \\ncountries had no regulations on any media type. Most of the countries that reported \\nno restrictions across all media types were located in the African (17 countries) or \\nAmericas regions (11 countries). \\n• \\nAlmost all (95%) countries have alcohol excise taxes, but fewer than half of them \\nuse the other price strategies such as adjusting taxes to keep up with inﬂation and \\nincome levels, imposing minimum pricing policies, or banning below-cost selling or \\nvolume discounts. \\n• \\nDisclosing the alcohol content on alcoholic beverage labels is required for beer, wine \\nand spirits in a majority of countries, but only a minority of countries requires basic \\nconsumer information such as calories and additives.

SDG 3 (Ensure healthy lives \\nand promoting well-being for all at all ages) is underpinned by 13 targets that cover a \\nwide spectrum of WHO’s work. Alcohol consumption is a unique risk factor for population \\nhealth as it affects the risks of approximately 230 three-digit disease and injury codes in \\nthe International Statistical Classiﬁcation of Diseases and Related Health Problems –10th \\nRevision (ICD-10) (Rehm et al., 2017a; WHO, 2007) including infectious diseases, \\nnoncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and injuries. Alcohol is speciﬁcally mentioned under \\nhealth Target 3.5: “Strengthen the prevention and treatment of substance use, including \\nnarcotic drug abuse and harmful use of alcohol”. The inclusion of a separate health \\ntarget to strengthen the prevention and treatment of substance use disorders under \\nSDG 3 illustrates the increased diversity of the new global development agenda and its \\nrecognition of harmful use of alcohol as a development issue in itself. \\nHowever, action to reduce the harmful use of alcohol will contribute to many other goals \\nand targets of the 2030 agenda. Almost all of the other 16 SDGs are directly related to \\nhealth or will contribute to health indirectly. The new agenda, which builds on the MDGs, \\naims to be relevant to all countries and focuses on improving equity to meet the needs \\nof women, children and the poorest, most disadvantaged people. Unlike the MDGs, the \\nSDGs are universal to all countries in terms of their nature and relevance, though how \\nnations need to act in the implementation of the goals will vary with their capacities, \\nrealities and developmental levels.\\nMajor foci in the SDGs are achieving sustainable economic growth (SDG 8), ending poverty \\n(SDG 1), reducing inequalities between and within countries (SDG 10) and achieving \\ngender equality (SDG 5). Alcohol production and consumption is highly relevant to each of \\nthese goals, although the relationships are often complex (Room & Jernigan, 2000). This \\nchapter lays out and considers some of these complexities, but it focuses on the impact \\nof alcohol consumption and the harmful use of alcohol on health within the context of \\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\\n1.2 ALCOHOL AND SDG 2030 HEALTH TARGETS\\nThe health and social harms from drinking alcohol occur through three main interrelated \\nmechanisms: 1) the toxic effects of alcohol on diverse organs and tissues in the \\nconsumer’s body (resulting, for instance, in liver disease, heart disease or cancer); 2) \\ndevelopment of alcohol dependence whereby the drinker’s self-control over his or her \\ndrinking is impaired, often involving alcohol-induced mental disorders such as depression \\nor psychoses; and 3) through intoxication – the psychoactive effects of alcohol in the hours \\nafter drinking (Babor et al., 2010). \\nThe impact of alcohol consumption on population health is presented in Chapter 4 of this \\nreport.

The association of alcohol \\nconsumption with engagement in unprotected sex (Scott-Sheldon et al., 2016; Rehm et \\nal., 2012) has been shown to increase the risk of experiencing unintended pregnancy \\n(Connery, Albright & Rodolico, 2014; Oulman et al., 2015; Lundsberg et al., 2018). Alcohol \\nand drug use also increase the risk of fetal exposure to alcohol due to delayed recognition \\nof pregnancy (Connery, Albright & Rodolico, 2014). This can continue to have negative \\nimplications for newborns (Schoeps et al., 2018). \\nAlcohol use during pregnancy has been established as a risk factor for adverse pregnancy \\noutcomes, including stillbirth, spontaneous abortion, premature birth, intrauterine growth \\nretardation and low birth weight (Henriksen et al., 2004; Kesmodel & Kesmodel, 2002; \\nPatra et al., 2010), and can result in a range of lifelong conditions known as fetal alcohol \\nspectrum disorders (FASD) (Chudley et al., 2005) (Box 1.3). \\nBox 1.3 Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) \\nFASD is an umbrella term which includes fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial fetal alcohol \\nsyndrome (pFAS), alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) and, depending on \\nthe diagnostic and classiﬁcation system, alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD) (Chudley et al., \\n2005; Cook et al., 2016; Hoyme et al., 2016). FASD is characterized by central nervous system \\ndamage and its manifestations include physical, mental and behavioural features and learning \\ndisabilities with possible lifelong implications.\\nA systematic review and meta-analysis by Popova and colleagues estimated that the global \\nprevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy in the general population amounts to 9.8% \\n(Popova et al., 2017). In addition, Lange and colleagues observed, at the country level, that \\nbinge drinking during pregnancy ranged from 0.2% to 13.9% (Lange et al., 2017). Drinking \\nduring pregnancy resulted in an estimated prevalence of FAS in the general population of \\n14.6 per 10 000 people and a prevalence of FASD of 77.3 per 10 000 people (Popova et al., \\n2017). The prevalence of FAS and FASD varies by WHO region, with the prevalence being \\nhighest in the Region of the Americas (AMR) and the European Region (EUR) (Figure 1.1). \\nAdditionally, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis by Popova and colleagues found \\nthat 428 conditions (which spanned 18 of the 22 ICD-10 chapters) co-occurred with FASD \\n(Popova et al., 2016). Some of the most common health problems are congenital malformations, \\nchromosomal abnormalities, prenatal and postnatal growth delays, intellectual disability, \\nbehavioural disorders, speech and language difﬁculties, visual and audiological impairments, \\ncardiac deformities and urogenital problems. \\n'),\n",

These neurocognitive \\nalterations by adolescents’ alcohol use seem to be related to behavioural, emotional, social \\nand academic problems in later life (Brown et al., 2008; Windle et al., 2008).\\nParental drinking or poor parent–adolescent relationship quality are among the factors \\nrelated to adolescent alcohol use (Hummel et al., 2013; Sharmin et al., 2017; Yap et al., \\n2017). \\nThere is a consistent and large amount of evidence demonstrating the positive association \\nbetween parental and offspring drinking (Rossow et al., 2016; Sharmin et al., 2017). \\nPerceived parental alcohol problems were associated signiﬁcantly with a higher likelihood \\nof frequent emotional symptoms, depression, low self-esteem and loneliness among \\nboth boys and girls (Pisinger, Bloomﬁeld & Tolstrup, 2016). In addition, parental heavy \\ndrinking and alcohol problems were shown to be associated with worse outcomes in \\nchildren, including educational outcomes (Mangiavacchi & Piccoli, 2018), drug use (Finan \\net al., 2018), conduct problems (Su et al., 2018) and criminality (af Klinteberg et al., 2011). \\nParental alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are associated with a higher risk of their children \\ndeveloping depression in adulthood (Wolfe, 2017; Fuller-Thomson et al., 2013). A number \\nof mediating factors in these associations have been identiﬁed, which can play a protective \\nrole by increasing resilience or, conversely, can aggravate the vulnerability of children of \\nparents with AUDs (Park & Schepp, 2015; Finan et al., 2018; Wolfe, 2017). \\n1.2.2 Infectious diseases\\nAlcohol consumption has been shown to increase the risk of HIV/AIDS by increasing the \\nrisk of transmission (resulting from an increased risk of unprotected sex (Rehm et al., \\n2017), and by increasing the risk of infection and subsequent mortality from tuberculosis \\nand lower respiratory infections by suppressing a wide range of immune responses via \\n'),\n",

Alcohol use \\nincreases sexual risks and could affect factors such as partner selection and the likelihood \\nof unprotected sex (Rehm et al., 2012; Williams et al., 2016). Greater quantities of alcohol \\nconsumed, rather than frequency of drinking, predict higher sexual risk (Kalichman et al., \\n2007). A meta-analysis drawing on 30 experimental studies (Scott-Sheldon et al., 2017) \\nwhich had randomly assigned subjects to remain sober or to drink to a blood alcohol \\ncontent (BAC) averaging 0.07%, and had then studied sexual decision-making after some \\nform of sexual stimulation, found that drinking to mild intoxication “directly affects sexual \\ndecision-making (e.g. intentions to engage in unprotected sex)”, which would result in \\nincreased sexual risk and potentially in HIV infection. Furthermore, there is a known \\nassociation between alcohol use and risk factors – including unprotected sex, sex with \\nmultiple partners, transactional sex and coercive sex – for HIV and sexually transmitted \\ninfections (STIs) (Woolf-King & Maisto, 2011) (Box 1.4). If left untreated, STIs (other than \\nHIV) pose an increased risk of acquiring an HIV infection. Women are often subjected to \\nthese risks by their male sexual partner’s alcohol use. Sexual violence is related to both \\nalcohol use and HIV risk (Baliunas et al., 2010). \\nBox 1.4 Alcohol and HIV/AIDS\\nThe harmful use of alcohol is associated both with an increased risk of acquiring HIV infection \\nand with negative effects on people living with HIV/AIDS in terms of treatment outcomes, \\nmorbidity and mortality (Baliunas et al., 2010; Bryant, 2006). The harmful use of alcohol has a \\nnegative impact on HIV infection and transmission in three main ways, namely: \\n• by increasing the risk of HIV transmission, notably through risky sexual behaviour such as \\ninconsistent condom use and engaging in multiple sexual partnerships (Reis et al., 2016);\\n• by having a negative impact on HIV treatment, including alcohol–drug interactions, toxicity \\nand/or reduction in treatment adherence and by increasing the risk of resistance to \\nantiretroviral medications (Gross et al., 2017; de Oliveira et al., 2016; Rehm et al., 2010a); \\n• by compromising immune responses, leading to increased biological susceptibility to \\ninfection through deterioration of various pathways of the immune system (Schuper et \\nal., 2010; Miguez et al., 2003), and disease progression (Neuman, Monteiro & Rehm, 2006; \\nNeuman et al., 2012).\\n1.2.2.2 Viral hepatitis \\nAssociation of the harmful use of alcohol with risky sexual behaviour and a higher risk \\nof common STIs can partially explain both the higher prevalence of viral hepatitis among \\npersons with AUDs in comparison with the general population (Cortes et al., 2017), and \\nthe association between chronic HCV infection and both former and excessive current \\ndrinking (Taylor et al., 2016). Alcohol consumption has a synergistic effect with viral \\nhepatitis in the progression of liver disease (Tikhanovich et al., 2014; Dolganiuc, 2015). In \\naddition, alcohol is a well-known causal factor for non-infectious liver diseases, including \\nhepatitis (Parker & Neuberger, 2018) and liver cirrhosis, and the latter is associated with \\nhigh mortality (Sandahl et al., 2010) (section 1.2.3.3). \\n'),\n",

The mechanisms of impact of alcohol use on tuberculosis are similar to those for \\nother infectious diseases (Box 1.5). \\nBox 1.5 Alcohol and tuberculosis\\nAlcohol consumption can suppress the immune system, which is documented in individuals \\nwith heavy alcohol exposure (Laprawat et al., 2017; Imtiaz et al., 2017; Nahid et al., 2016; \\nLönnroth et al., 2008), which increases the risk for active tuberculosis. The risk rises with \\nthe increase in levels of alcohol consumption. There is a three-fold increase in the risk of \\ntuberculosis associated with a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder (Imtiaz et al., 2017). \\nAlcohol consumption can inﬂuence the absorption and metabolism of tuberculosis drugs \\nand increases the risk of chemically-driven liver damage (hepatotoxicity), which is already a \\ncommon side effect of tuberculosis medications (Pande et al., 1996; Rehm et al., 2009a). \\nPeople with alcohol use disorders are at greater risk for poor treatment adherence, treatment \\nfailure and drug-resistant tuberculosis infection (De Gennaro et al., 2017).\\n1.2.3 Major noncommunicable diseases \\nThe relationship between alcohol consumption and major NCDs is well documented \\n(IARC, 2010; Rehm et al., 2010b; Lim, Vos & Flaxman, 2012), and reducing the harmful \\nuse of alcohol in populations is one of prerequisites of effective NCD prevention and \\ncontrol (Room et al., 2011; Beaglehole et al., 2011; Ezzati & Riboli., 2012; WHO, 2013). \\nThe estimates of alcohol-attributable burden of NCDs are presented in Chapter 4. \\n1.2.3.1 Cardiovascular diseases\\nNumerous epidemiological studies have observed a complex relationship between both \\nthe volume and patterns of alcohol consumption and the occurrence of cardiovascular \\ndiseases (Roerecke & Rehm, 2012; Klatsky, 2015; O’Keefe et al., 2014). Speciﬁcally, \\nvolume and patterns of alcohol consumption have been shown to increase the risk of \\nhypertensive heart disease (Taylor et al., 2009; Briasoulis, Agarwal & Messerli, 2012), \\ncardiomyopathy (Lacovoni, De Maria & Gavazzi, 2010), atrial ﬁbrillation and ﬂutter (Kodama \\net al., 2011), and haemorrhagic and other non-ischaemic strokes (Patra et al., 2010). The \\nrelationship between alcohol and the onset of ischaemic heart disease or ischaemic \\nstrokes is complex; people who consume low-to-moderate amounts of alcohol and do not \\nengage in irregular heavy drinking have a lower disease risk, while people who engage \\nin irregular heavy drinking or who consume higher volumes of alcohol have a higher \\ndisease risk (Roerecke & Rehm, 2010; Leong et al., 2014; Guiraud et al., 2010; Roerecke \\n& Rehm, 2014).\\n1.2.3.2 Cancers \\nThere is an established causal link between alcohol use and cancer development in the \\noropharynx, larynx, oesophagus, liver, colon, rectum and the female breast (Bagnardi \\net al., 2015; IARC, 2009). The risks are generally higher for females than males. Even \\nmoderate alcohol intake has been shown to increase the risk of developing female \\nbreast cancer (Bagnardi et al., 2015). The biological mechanisms of alcohol-related \\ncarcinogenesis are not entirely understood, but several pathways have been identiﬁed \\n'),\n",

Most notably, alcohol \\nhas been shown to damage permanently the DNA strands in the cell, and to inhibit DNA \\nrepair processes from functioning, particularly through acetaldehyde – the immediate \\nproduct of alcohol metabolism. Alcohol use may also lead to nutritional deﬁciencies that \\naffect DNA processing pathways (Boffetta & Hashibe, 2006). Some genetic variations are \\nalso associated with an increased risk from alcohol in cancer development (IARC, 2009; \\nScoccianti, Straif & Romieu, 2013). Alcohol is also thought to modulate estrogen pathways, \\nthus increasing the risk for development of breast cancer in females (Cao et al., 2015).\\n1.2.3.3 Liver diseases\\nThe causal relationship of alcohol consumption and liver diseases is well established, and \\nalcohol has been shown to have an ability to cause hepatocellular damage through ethanol \\nmetabolism-associated mechanisms and malnutrition (Gao & Bataller, 2011). Alcohol \\nis one of the most frequent causes of liver disease; alcohol-involved subtypes of liver \\ndisease include alcoholic hepatitis, steatosis, steatohepatitis, ﬁbrosis and cirrhosis. Acute \\nalcoholic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis are associated with high mortality (which can reach \\n50% in acute alcohol hepatitis), and the median survival time of patients with advanced \\nliver cirrhosis can be as low as 1–2 years (Bruha, Dvorak & Petrtyl, 2012).

This dimension of \\nthe impact of drinking alcohol is often left to the police, welfare and justice systems to \\nresolve but it should be a major concern for public health. \\n \\nAlcohol is a psychoactive substance, affecting various neural pathways and parts of \\nthe brain, with its effects depending on the dose ingested, on genetic factors, on the \\nlearned experience of the drinker, as well as on aspects of the setting (Oscar-Berman & \\nMarinkovi´c, 2007; Giancola et al., 2010). The potential variety of effects from alcohol is \\nespecially large. The potential effects of alcohol include impairment in attention, cognition \\nand dexterity (which are important for such activities as driving a car); aggressive impulses \\nand loss of behavioural control (important for criminal violence); and alcohol poisoning \\n(which can be fatal). Each of these effects tends to affect the drinker, on average, at a \\ndifferent threshold: driving impairment at a BAC below 0.05%; aggression at a BAC of \\nabout 0.075% (Duke et al., 2011); and overdose at a BAC of around 0.35% (calculated \\nfrom Gable, 2004). However, there is much individual variation in these effects, not only \\nin terms of how much alcohol precipitates them but also, for some effects, in terms \\nof whether they occur at all: for instance, only a minority of the population will display \\naggression (Giancola et al., 2010). \\nAlcohol intoxication plays a large role in alcohol’s contribution to the global burden of \\ndisease through its role in alcohol-related injuries – including intentional injuries, but also \\nin other health conditions that lead, for example, to cardiovascular deaths (George & \\nFigueredo, 2010). Beyond causing harm to the drinker, alcohol intoxication is often the \\nmain mechanism of harm to others from drinking (Box 1.8).\\nBox 1.8 Harm to others from drinking \\nThe harms to health are only part of the total alcohol-related harm. Harms from drinking \\noccur not only to the drinker, but also to those around him or her – to others in the family or \\nhousehold, to relatives and friends, and to those encountered on the street. The harms may \\nbe to health (e.g. injury, a family member’s anxiety or depression, transmission of infection \\nto a sexual partner), or may be social (e.g. assault, community nuisance) or economic (e.g. \\ndamage to property, money for family necessities spent on drinking) (Karriker-Jaffe et al., \\n2018). Alcohol intoxication plays a large part in harms to others from drinking. In an Australian \\nnational adult sample, those who had been harmed in the last year by the drinking of a relative \\nor other person known to them were asked about that person’s drinking patterns. The average \\nresponse was that the person drank ﬁve or more drinks (50 grams or more of ethanol) four \\ntimes a week, and 13 drinks when drinking heavily (Laslett et al., 2010). Those most seriously \\nharmed by another’s drinking are likely to be other members of the household. To the extent \\nthat drinking, and particularly heavy drinking, is more common among adult males, the others \\nin the family – the female partner and children – are particularly likely to be adversely affected, \\nboth in terms of the drinker’s behaviour after drinking and in terms of shared family resources \\nbeing expended on or in the course of the drinking (Laslett et al., 2017a; 2017b). Within the \\nfamily, in other words, there is on average more drinking by the member with the highest social \\nstanding, but the harms from the drinking are spread more evenly. Outside the household, the \\nadverse effects of drinking are more evenly spread in the population, though other drinkers \\nmay be at greater risk than abstainers (Waleewong et al., 2018). \\n'),\n",

Alcohol \\ncontributes to the occurrence of both unintentional injuries (road trafﬁc injuries, drowning, \\nburns, poisoning, falls) and intentional injuries (suicide, interpersonal violence). The exact \\nmagnitude of the problem of alcohol-related injuries is unclear in many low- and middle-\\nincome countries but the overall burden of alcohol-attributable injuries is substantial \\n(Chapter 4, section 4.2.3). \\n1.2.5.2 Trafﬁc injuries\\nThe important part that alcohol plays in trafﬁc injuries is well established. The main focus \\nin preventive policies and programmes has often been on the drinking driver; it is now \\nwell recognized that a driver’s attention and driving skills are increasingly undermined \\naccording to how many drinks he or she has had before driving, with the decrement in \\nperformance starting with the second drink. In many countries, there are laws against \\ndrink–driving after drinking more than a small amount – usually deﬁned in terms of BAC \\n(e.g. 0.05%). It is not only the driver’s drinking which contributes to road trafﬁc injuries. \\nA minor contribution to the statistics may come from drunken passengers in a vehicle \\nwho distract or interfere with the driver. Much more important numerically are drunken \\npedestrians. In South Africa, for instance, with a road trafﬁc death rate (39.7 per 100 000 \\neach year) double the global rate, it is estimated that 40% of road trafﬁc deaths in 2007 \\nwere of pedestrians and over half of these pedestrians had a BAC above the legal limit \\nfor driving (Seedat et al., 2009). A study in Tayside, Scotland, found that intoxicated \\npedestrians constituted one third of road trafﬁc deaths related to alcohol (Foster et al., \\n1988). At a hospital trauma centre in Melbourne, Australia, from 2009–2014, 24.7% of \\npedestrians injured in road trafﬁc crashes were intoxicated (Mitra et al., 2017).\\nThe role of alcohol in trafﬁc injuries is well recognized, and laws against drink–driving are \\nperhaps the most universal legal controls on drinking (Chapter 5). However, the laws need \\nto be implemented and quite intensively enforced if they are to be effective in deterring \\ndrink–driving and reducing rate of alcohol-related casualties (Ross, 1984; Anderson, \\nChisholm & Fuhr, 2009). The relatively high rate of alcohol-related trafﬁc casualties in \\nmany countries is strong evidence that enforcement of the laws is often weak. \\n1.2.5.3 Aggression and violence\\nA review of recent literature on the links between substance use and aggression found \\nthat “the research supporting the relation between all forms of aggression and alcohol use \\nis enormous [and] unequivocal”, while noting that “this relationship is likely moderated \\nby individual difference and contextual factors [and] is most prominently demonstrated \\nin men” (Tomlinson, Brown & Hoaken, 2016). Experimental studies have found a dose–\\nresponse connection between BAC and aggression, with the effects becoming signiﬁcant \\nwith a BAC of 0.05%, and rising with higher BAC levels (Duke et al., 2011).  \\nWhile earlier studies often focused on alcohol’s role in street violence, predominantly \\nmale-on-male, there has been an increased focus in recent years on alcohol’s role in \\nviolence in the family and in intimate relations, including sexual violence. Studies of alcohol \\ninvolvement in sexual aggression perpetration by young males have generally found a \\nstrong connection (Abbey et al., 2014), though the studies have been in a limited range \\n'),\n",

A survey study in 10 central and southern European countries \\nfound that both sexual aggression and sexual victimization were associated with drinking \\nin conjunction with sex, but not with the respondent’s general drinking patterns. “Male \\n[sexual aggression] perpetration rates were also higher the more regularly men drank \\nalcohol in sexual interactions. For women, the link between alcohol use when having sex \\nand sexual aggression perpetration was nonsigniﬁcant” (Krahé et al., 2015). A survey of \\nmen in six middle- and low-income countries in Asia and the Paciﬁc found that men in \\nnon-Muslim majority countries who acknowledged “alcohol misuse” (based on AUDIT \\nitems on alcohol consumption and on social defaults due to drinking) reported higher \\nrates of intimate partner sexual violence, including physical violence in connection with \\nsex (Fulu et al., 2013). \\n1.2.5.4 Homicides\\nDrinking by the perpetrator or by the victim or by both is frequently a factor in homicide, \\narguably the most extreme form of aggression. The connection between drinking and \\nhomicide is strongest in societies where drinking is often heavy enough to induce \\nintoxication; thus, changes in the population level of alcohol consumption have a \\nconsiderably stronger effect on homicide rates in northern and eastern Europe than in \\nsouthern Europe (Rossow, 2001; Pridemore & Chamlin, 2006). Studies of drinking by the \\noffender and by the victim in homicides have chieﬂy been in societies where drinking \\nto intoxication is common. Meta-analyses of these studies have found that 48% both \\nof victims and of perpetrators had been drinking when the homicide occurred, and that \\n37% of the offenders and 33–35% of the victims had drunk enough to be intoxicated \\n(Kuhns et al., 2011; 2014).\\n1.2.5.5 Alcohol poisoning \\nAlcohol poisoning is a consequence of drinking large amounts of alcohol in a short period \\nof time. Drinking too much in a short period of time can affect breathing, heart rate, body \\ntemperature and gag reﬂex and may result in a coma and death. In comparisons with \\nother psychoactive substances, alcohol is among the most lethal in terms of how close \\nthe amounts used for psychoactive effects are to the median amount that is lethal. Thus, \\nusing 33 grams of ethanol (about three drinks) as the “usual effective dose” of alcohol, \\nGable (2004) found a ratio of 10 between that and a “usual lethal dose” of 330 grams. \\nThis ratio was in the same range as that for intravenous heroin (Hendershot et al., 2009), \\nmethamphetamine (Sarkar, Jung & Wang, 2015) and cocaine (Whiteford et al., 2013). For \\nmany other psychoactive substances these ratios are considerably higher, and the use is \\nthus less likely to result in death (see also Lachenmeier & Rehm, 2015) although it may \\ntrigger other health- or life-threatening conditions such as severe functional impairment \\nin intoxication or substance-induced psychoses.\\nWhile poisoning clusters from contaminated alcohol often receive global press coverage, \\npoisoning with ordinary beverage alcohol – usually in concentrated form such as distilled \\nbeverages – is an everyday reality in many societies, although it is often under-recorded \\nin health statistics (Dufour & Caces, 1993). Alcohol poisoning statistics are especially high \\nin the Russian Federation and some eastern European countries (Stickley et al., 2007). \\nThe Russian experience in recent decades shows that rates of alcohol poisoning can be \\naffected by alcohol policies and economic circumstances (Razvodovsky, 2018; Neufeld \\n& Rehm, 2018) (see also Box 5.1 in Chapter 5). \\n'),\n",

Thus within any society, poorer people are more likely to be abstainers than \\nricher people (Bloomﬁeld et al., 2006). Comparing across societies, rates of abstinence \\nare higher in poorer societies than in richer ones (Probst, Manthey & Rehm, 2017). The \\nrelationship between a societal abstinence rate and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) \\nis particularly strong below a GDP threshold of about US$ 20 000 per capita per annum in \\n2010 (measured in purchasing power parity [PPP] dollars; Probst, Manthey & Rehm, 2017).\\nAlthough other factors are also involved, the patterns within a society and across societies \\nreﬂect the fact that alcoholic beverages are commodities that require expenditure in a cash \\neconomy and resources in a barter or gift economy. However, policies leading to an increase \\nin alcohol consumption in poorer societies or in lower-income segments of populations can \\nbe detrimental to achieving the SDGs. The resources spent on alcohol would be subtracted \\nfrom more productive uses in the long run, and the harms from drinking often include \\nimpoverishment as well as ill-health (Saxena, Sharma & Maulik, 2003).\\n1.3.2 Variations in amount and pattern of drinking by status within a \\nsociety \\nIn many societies, access to alcoholic beverages has been greater for those who are \\naccorded higher or more privileged status. Where alcohol is a market commodity, this \\nwill be partly a reﬂection of how much money the person has for purchasing (Kan & Lau, \\n2013), but it also commonly reﬂects social status differentiations.\\nOne traditional differentiation has been with regard to gender. Men generally drink \\nconsiderably more alcohol than women, both on heavier-drinking occasions and in terms \\nof the volume of drinking; the gender difference is generally greater where there is greater \\ngender inequality (Wilsnack et al., 2009). The difference is considerably more than would \\nbe accounted for by gender differences in body weight and composition. Within a given \\nsociety, the gender differentiation is often greater among poorer people than among \\nricher ones. In high-income countries it is common for the more afﬂuent to drink more \\nfrequently on average than poorer persons (e.g. Bloomﬁeld et al., 2006), although in less \\nafﬂuent societies there is some variation on this (Room et al., 2006). \\nFor the risk of harm both to the drinker and to others, the most important aspects of \\ndrinking are a hazardous volume of drinking (deﬁned approximately as averaging more \\n'),\n",

In a majority of \\ncountries men with less education were more likely to report hazardous drinking and HED. \\nAmong women, those with more education and those with higher income/occupational \\nstatus were more likely to report high-risk drinking (though less than higher-status men) \\nin all but two countries.

Increases are particularly \\nlikely when the alcohol market is freed up in a context of economic development. Thus in \\nViet Nam for example, there was a 50% increase in alcohol production in a decade, with \\nthe proportion of adults drinking rising from 46% to 77% among men and 2% to 11% \\namong women between 2002 and 2016 (Pham, Tran & Tran, 2018). \\nAlthough increased afﬂuence may weaken the link of alcohol consumption to some harms \\n(see below), the level of health harms from drinking is likely to rise, with some delay, \\nwith an increase in overall consumption in a population – often at a higher rate than the \\nrise in consumption. The higher rise in the rate of harms reﬂects that, while increases \\nin consumption are usually roughly proportional in different segments of the population \\n(Room & Livingston, 2017), the risk curve relationship between the alcohol consumption \\nlevel and the rate of harm often rises more steeply at higher levels of consumption. \\n1.3.4 Health harm from alcohol use: less for more afﬂuent drinkers\\nOn a cross-sectional aggregate basis, there seems to be a moderately negative relation \\nbetween gross national income and levels of health harm from alcohol (Figure 4.19). The \\nincreased high-risk behaviour in a richer society seems to be more than counterbalanced \\nby changes in other factors which go along with greater societal afﬂuence. \\nOn an individual level, however, the negative relation between socioeconomic status and \\nalcohol-attributable mortality has been shown to be much stronger. As further discussed \\nin section 1.3.5, the “harm per litre” of alcohol is substantially greater for poorer drinkers \\nthan for richer ones. Particularly within higher-income countries, the socioeconomic \\ndifferences in alcohol-attributable mortality have been found to be about 1.5 to 2 times \\nthe size of those in all-cause mortality (Probst et al., 2014). A modelling study of alcohol-\\nattributable mortality in South Africa, an upper-middle-income country, found a similar \\nsocioeconomic gap, with 60% of all alcohol-attributable deaths occurring in the lower \\n30% of the socioeconomic distribution (Probst et al., 2018). \\n'),\n",

This \\ngreater “harm per litre” is a consistent ﬁnding for many different kinds of harms from \\ndrinking – e.g. chronic diseases such as liver cirrhosis; injuries from drinking, both to the \\ndrinker and to others around the drinker; and infectious diseases where drinking plays \\na role in vulnerability to or spread of the infection or in disrupting the treatment regime. \\nA number of mechanisms can play a part in this differential effect in a given society: \\n• \\nIn more afﬂuent families, there will be more possibilities for spatial separation from \\nthe drinking and its effects. \\n• \\nThe drinking environment itself also often differs by socioeconomic status, potentially \\nmodifying the relationship between alcohol use and related risks. For example, \\nresearch has shown an association between the setting of alcohol consumption \\nbefore sex and risky sexual behaviour such as unprotected sex (Kalichman et al., \\n2008; Scott-Sheldon et al., 2014). Other contextual factors that are likely to work to \\nthe disadvantage of persons of lower socioeconomic status with respect to alcohol-\\nattributable harm are crowded living arrangements, lack of sanitation and a higher \\nlikelihood of social conﬂict and aggression in their social environment (Rehm et al., \\n2009b; Rossow, 1996). \\n• \\nWhere health care is not universal, afﬂuence will play a role in the adequacy of health \\ntreatment and care. \\n• \\nPoorer drinkers are likely to have more comorbidity, which worsens the adverse \\neffects of the drinking.   \\n• \\nSome of the harm connected to heavy drinking arises from social reactions to drinking \\nand intoxicated behaviour. In many societies, drunkenness is stigmatized, particularly \\nwhen the drinker is poor. In a 14-country WHO study, alcohol-involved characterizations \\nwere uniformly considered among the most stigmatized of behaviours or states asked \\nabout (Room, 2005; Room et al., 2006). \\n• \\nIn part reﬂecting the stigma, reverse causation can also play a role; for very heavy \\ndrinkers, the drinking may reduce their employability and social standing.\\nA recent Scottish study (Katikireddi et al., 2017; Table 1.2) illustrates how dramatically the \\n“harm per litre” can vary across categories of ﬁnancial position or status in a society. In \\nthis study the rates of alcohol-induced hospitalization or death are strongly predicted by \\nsocial status, however this is measured (Box 1.9), and the study’s overall results provide \\ndramatic evidence that socioeconomic status modiﬁes the effect of alcohol consumption \\non harm to health. The study’s results underline how much work still needs to be done – \\nboth in research and in policy interventions – on interactions between drinking behaviour \\nand other factors related to or affected by social status. As the authors stated, “our \\nﬁndings highlight the need for policy to prioritize the tackling of inequalities in alcohol-\\nattributable harms”.\\n'),\n",

For each of these four measures \\nof socioeconomic status, there was a regular gradient of proportional hazard by level of \\nsocioeconomic status, with the greatest additional proportional hazard usually between the \\nlowest and next-to-lowest category.

Some factors involved at the individual level also \\noperate differently between poorer and richer societies. For instance, the grading and \\nfurnishing of streets in a poorer country may be less likely to avert crashes. Impairments \\nof health which interact with the effects of alcohol may mean worse outcomes for a \\ngiven pattern of drinking than in richer societies. Thus Grittner et al. (2012), comparing \\npopulation surveys in 25 countries and controlling for drinking patterns, found that male \\ndrinkers reported a higher rate of adverse external consequences of their drinking in \\nlower-income countries than in higher-income countries. \\nNevertheless, economic development from a poorer society to a richer one does not \\nnecessarily reduce rates of harm from alcohol. Historically, in many European societies \\nand empires, industrialization of alcoholic beverages was an early aspect of the industrial \\nrevolution, and rates of heavy drinking and of harms from drinking rose steeply as the \\navailability of alcoholic beverages increased and the relative price dropped (e.g. Rorabaugh, \\nBox 1.10 Implications of the commercialization of alcohol in developing societies: evidence \\nfrom ethnographic studies \\nEthnographic studies have described the mechanisms through which the commercial \\nproduction of alcohol has generated, and continues to generate, socioeconomic and \\nhealth disparities in developing countries (Room et al., 2006; Schmidt & Room, 2012). The \\ncommercialization of alcohol was often an integral part of growing economic inequality \\nand typically leads to the widening availability of foreign brands of alcoholic beverages. \\nDeveloping societies are transformed into consumer markets where new forms of alcoholic \\nbeverages become symbols of elite social status. This dynamic typically brings more drinking \\nand thus a greater burden of alcohol-related problems on the population. In some societies, \\nincreased consumption interacts with culturally-determined patterns of behaviour and gender \\nroles to produce explosive drinking styles, resulting in extremely high levels of violence and \\npublic disruption.\\nThe burden of rising alcohol problems seldom falls evenly across socioeconomic groups. \\nWhen the poor become a consumer market, purchasing commercial brands of alcohol takes \\na larger toll on personal and family income than it does in other social classes. The poor are \\nalso more vulnerable to the public disruption, violence and health-related harms that come \\nwith increased alcohol consumption.\\nIn developing countries we ﬁnd a general trend towards the greater availability of alcohol around \\nthe clock, and a shift towards the commercialized production of European-style beverages \\nby increasingly globalized producers. In some cases, these changes in alcohol production \\nplay a direct role in generating economic disparities, as in cases where industrialized alcohol \\nproduction takes over control of alcohol production from local communities and indigenous \\ngroups. For instance, in rural Zambia (Colson & Scudder, 1988), where beer brewing used to \\nbe an important source of income for local women, the increased availability of commercial \\nbrands of beer added to the economic burden on village families as men spent their wages on \\nbottled beer. The women, in turn, lacked any independent income to make up the difference for \\ntheir families, having lost their income from producing beer. As the men drank more frequently \\nand heavily, the local community experienced more violence towards women and more health \\nproblems related to heavy drinking. Local authorities failed to respond with alcohol control \\npolicies, in part because of their institutionalized dependency on alcohol revenue.\\nSources: Room et al., 2006; Schmidt & Room, 2012.\\n'),\n",

In many societies, it took a century and more of grassroots temperance \\nmovements and public health control measures to bring down the rates of alcohol-related \\nharm which had risen with economic development (Room et al., 2009; Nicholls, 2009). \\nIn most low- and middle-income societies in recent decades, the commercialization of \\nalcohol has been proceeding faster. The commercialization of alcohol markets in Eastern \\nEurope after the dissolution of the Soviet Union provides some dramatic recent examples \\nof increases in alcohol consumption levels and in associated harms, which have now been \\ncountered to a considerable extent in some countries by new market control measures \\n(e.g. Russia: Rabiee et al., 2017; Neufeld & Rehm, 2018). Evidence on the often serious \\nadverse health and social effects of increases in alcohol consumption with socioeconomic \\ndevelopment comes not only from health and social statistics, but from ethnographic \\nstudies (Box 1.10). Given that alcohol’s role in economic development is so double-edged \\n(Room & Jernigan, 2000), control of the alcohol market in the interests of public health \\nbecomes especially important when rapid economic development is under way. \\n1.4 ALCOHOL AND USE OF OTHER PSYCHOACTIVE \\nSUBSTANCES\\nTarget 3.5 of SDG3 is devoted to substance abuse, reﬂecting the global awareness that \\nthe achievement of healthy lives and well-being for all at all ages is hardly possible without \\nstrengthening the prevention of psychoactive substance use and provision of treatment \\nfor substance use disorders to all those in need. The use of psychoactive substances, \\nincluding alcohol, is widespread in modern societies, and at individual level the use of \\nseveral psychoactive substances is more of a rule than an exception.\\nPsychoactive substances have diverse effects and taking a second substance can amplify \\nor build on the effect of the ﬁrst, or it may diminish or counteract it, or the combination \\nof the two substances may be experienced as a different effect. In everyday life, many \\npeople routinely alternate mundane stimulants like coffee, tea or tobacco and depressants \\nlike alcohol to change their mood and degree of alertness, often without conscious thought \\nabout doing so (Kiepek, Beagan & Harris, 2018).\\nPsychoactive substances can thus be complementary in various modes of use, so that \\nusing one substance may be positively associated with using another. On the other hand, \\nthey can substitute for one another; if one substance becomes too expensive, unavailable \\nor risky, another may be substituted for it. For a very heavy consumer with substance \\ndependence, if the supply of the usual substance is cut off it becomes a matter of urgency \\nto ﬁnd a supply of a cross-dependent substance as a substitute.\\nHeavy consumers of alcohol are also more likely to be heavy tobacco smokers and \\nfrequent consumers of other psychoactive substances. Harms which can arise from heavy \\nalcohol use will often reﬂect the joint actions/effects of two or more substances. The \\njoint effect may be multiplicative rather than additive. For instance, a Swedish longitudinal \\nstudy found that the relative risk of head and neck cancers from heavy use of alcohol was \\n4.2 and from regular cigarette smoking was 6.3; however, from both behaviours together \\nthe relative risk was 22.1 (Lewin et al., 1998).\\nStudies of emergency hospital cases have found that a wide variety of controlled \\npsychoactive substances are commonly taken before, along with, or after alcohol, so \\nthat both substances are affecting the body.

Thus in New York \\nCity in 1998, 28% of the 537 overdose deaths involving an opioid also involved alcohol, \\nas did 24% of the 498 deaths involving cocaine (calculated from Cofﬁn et al., 2003). The \\nalcohol involvement in these deaths is often obscured by coding rules which prioritize \\nother substances as the underlying cause of death; for instance, a 2006 update of the \\nICD-10 gave priority to opioids over other substances in this coding (Alexander, Barbieri \\n& Kiang, 2017). \\nThe comorbidity between alcohol dependence and tobacco dependence is strong. \\nEstimates from the 1980s in the USA were that over 80% of those with alcohol \\ndependence also smoked heavily, and that about 40% of heavy tobacco smokers would \\nalso qualify as having AUDs (Littleton et al., 2007). Discussing “the multiple levels of \\nconnections” between smoking and drinking, Room (2004b) commented that “each \\ntends to be a risk factor for the other”. \\nSuch a relationship between commodities is “complementary”. In the terminology of \\neconomics,  a fall in the price or rise in the availability of one commodity is associated \\nwith a rise in the use of both commodities, as opposed to a “substitutive” relationship, \\nwhere the use of the second commodity falls when the ﬁrst commodity becomes more \\navailable. Where two substances are complementary it means that a public health \\nmeasure to reduce the use of one problematic substance will tend also to have a beneﬁcial \\neffect in reducing the use of the other. Conversely, for a substitutive relationship the \\nbeneﬁcial effect with respect to one substance will tend to have a deleterious effect with \\nrespect to the other. However, in this case the perceived net result from a public health \\nperspective may still be favourable, as when older Californian cannabis users argued from \\ntheir experience with substituting cannabis for alcohol and for various medications and \\nother drugs (Lau et al., 2015).\\nWhether alcohol is complementary to or substitutive for another substance, and to what \\nextent, may vary by population and time. What happens among heavy users is important \\nfrom the perspective of public health, since they will account for more than their expected \\nshare of health and social harms from use of the substance. It is also important to \\nproducers and others involved in the market for the substance, since all psychoactive \\nsubstances “have highly skewed consumption distributions” (Kleiman, 1999). For most \\npsychoactive substances, the heaviest 20% of users tend to account for some 80% of \\nthe market (for cigarettes, heavy smokers account for an even larger fraction). Thus, 56% \\nof the alcohol consumed in Australia is in drinks above the level of the low-risk guidelines \\nthat are aimed at helping people avoid chronic health harm; the 28% of the adult population \\ndoing this drinking account altogether for 84% of the total consumption when their drinks \\nup to the guideline levels are counted in (Callinan et al., 2018). The skewed distribution \\nof consumption means that the heavy users’ patterns of consumption will dominate in \\nanalyses of complementarity or substitution based on aggregate consumption data.\\nIn terms of markets as a whole, a series of studies in high-income countries – e.g. Australia \\n(Cameron & Williams, 2001), Germany (Tauchmann et al., 2013) and Italy (Pierani & Tiezzi, \\n2009) – have found that tobacco and alcohol are complementary goods – i.e. that changes \\nin one direction in the volume of use of one substance are associated with changes in the \\n'),\n",

It has often been found that alcohol changes \\naffect tobacco more than tobacco changes affect alcohol (e.g. Pierani & Tiezzi, 2009). \\nStudies on alcohol and cannabis, primarily on teenage or university student populations, \\nhave had more mixed results. Analysis of Australian population surveys found “some \\nevidence to suggest that cannabis and alcohol are substitutes”, although decriminalization \\nof cannabis use in some Australian states went along with higher alcohol use (Cameron \\n& Williams, 2001). A United States study of teenage samples found some evidence for \\nsubstitution in the youngest cohort (aged about 13 years) – binge drinking decreased after \\nmedical marijuana became available – but there was no signiﬁcant change for those aged \\nabout 15 and 17 years (Cerdá et al., 2018). On the other hand, Williams et al. (2004) found \\nevidence that alcohol and cannabis were complementary among college students in the \\nUSA. Likewise, Pape, Rossow & Storvoll (2009) found complementarity among European \\nteenagers: 80% of Norwegians aged 14–20 years who used cannabis had drunk alcohol \\nat the same time and, in 35 European countries, the majority of 15–16-year-olds who had \\nused cannabis had been drinking alcohol at the same time. An Australian study, using \\nnational drug survey data, did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant effects in terms of complementarity \\nversus substitution either for any use or for the amount of use (Zhao & Harris, 2004). \\nThe economists’ contrast of complementarity versus substitution can be – and has \\nbeen – applied to a variety of circumstances. In a study using aggregate-level data, such \\nas amounts sold in a state or nation, ﬁnding complementarity between substance A \\nand substance B might be the result of different consumers deciding independently to \\npurchase more of one substance or another than they had purchased before. For instance, \\nthis “complementarity” might simply reﬂect an increase in average incomes. Even with \\nindividual-level longitudinal data, an increase in purchasing of both A and B does not \\nnecessarily mean that the substances are being used in conjunction – A might be for \\nweekdays and B for weekends. At the other end of the spectrum, use in conjunction \\nraises potential concerns about multiplicative risks – as with head and neck cancers, \\nwhere the multiplicative risk may well reﬂect interactive effects when the smoking and \\ndrinking are contemporaneous. \\nHowever, many of the possible policy strategies to reduce substance use or its harms are \\nquite distal to any mechanisms of joint action. With respect to the alcohol and cigarette \\ncombination, the consistent ﬁnding of complementarity raises the possibility for policy-\\nmaking to affect two risk factors by measures directed at one of them, with the empirical \\nstudies suggesting that the alcohol level is the more powerful in affecting the level of \\nuse of the other substance. The fact that the literature is quite mixed on the relationship \\nbetween cannabis and alcohol suggests that this combination needs to be approached \\ndifferently. In this case, the most obvious harm from combined use is in activities like \\ndriving where concentration and alertness are important; public health-oriented policies \\ndirected at complementary use might focus on discouraging the combination of concurrent \\nuse and driving or an analogous activity. For the combination of alcohol and opioids, the \\nmain public health problem with concomitant use is overdose, which might therefore be \\na focus of preventive measures.\\n'),\n",

GLOBAL STRATEGIES, ACTION \\nPLANS AND MONITORING \\nFRAMEWORKS\\n2.1 GLOBAL STRATEGIES AND ACTION PLANS \\nAlcohol is a psychoactive substance with toxic and dependence-producing properties. \\nAlthough alcohol consumption varies considerably around the world, the health burden \\ncaused by alcohol is enormous. The harmful use of alcohol is among the leading risk \\nfactors for disease burden in populations worldwide (Chapter 4). \\n2.1.1 Regulation of alcohol and other psychoactive substances at \\ninternational level \\nThroughout the history of alcohol use in societies there are many examples of regulation \\nof alcohol production, distribution and consumption, some of them going back to ancient \\ntimes (Bickel & DeGrandpre, 2013; Paredes, 1975). However, attempts to address the \\nharmful use of alcohol at international level have a much shorter and different history \\nthan for some other psychoactive substances with signiﬁcant impact on human health. \\nWhile the ﬁrst international treaty to control psychoactive substances was concerned with \\nalcohol, it related to only one part of the world (in colonial Africa) and had no signiﬁcant \\nimpact on alcohol production and trade for decades (Room, 2006). Neither alcohol nor \\ntobacco was included in the modern international drug control treaties when they were \\nadopted during 1961–1988 (The International Drug Control Conventions; UN , 2013). With \\ndevelopment and ratiﬁcation of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) in \\nresponse to the globalization of the tobacco epidemic (WHO, 2003), alcohol remains the \\nonly psychoactive and dependence-producing substance with signiﬁcant global impact \\non population health that is not controlled at the international level by legally-binding \\nregulatory frameworks. On the other hand, as a consumer product and trade item, \\nalcohol comes under the jurisdiction of international trade treaties and the international \\ntrade system, which have focused on maximizing the freedom of international trade and \\ninvestment and thereby minimizing “technical barriers to trade and other alcohol control \\nmeasures” that national or local governments may impose. While there are “public \\nhealth” exceptions in the treaties, these are interpreted narrowly, so that a provision in \\nthe interest of public health is not accepted if an alternative measure can be put forward \\nas an option, whether or not the measure would be effective (O’Brien et al., 2017). \\nGiven the increasing encroachment of international trade and investment on the ability of \\nnational and subnational governments to control their alcohol markets, and the increasingly \\nconsolidated global alcohol producers, a strong public health case for considering the \\nnegotiation of a Framework Convention on Alcohol Control, or alternatively for including \\nalcohol within other international control systems (Room et al., 2008), has been repeatedly \\npresented and discussed by public health entities, experts and advocates (The Lancet, \\n2007; Casswell & Thamarangsi, 2009; Baumberg 2010).\\n'),\n",

Since the global action plan on NCDs was \\nendorsed in 2013, Appendix 3 has been updated to take into consideration the emergence \\nof new evidence of cost-effectiveness and the issuance of new WHO recommendations \\nthat show evidence of effective interventions. The updated Appendix 3 highlighting the \\nmost cost-effective interventions, renamed as “best buys”, was endorsed in May 2017 \\nby the Seventieth World Health Assembly (WHO, 2017b). Interventions included in the \\nrevised Appendix 3 were assessed for cost-effectiveness and feasibility as well as non-\\nﬁnancial considerations. “Best buys” were deﬁned as the most cost-effective and feasible \\nfor implementation interventions, with an average cost-effectiveness ratio of ≤ $I per 100 \\nDALYs averted in low-income and lower-middle-income countries. Interventions with an \\naverage cost-effectiveness ratio of > $I per 100 DALYs averted were listed next as highly \\neffective interventions that may be considered according to the country context. The \\nupdated Appendix 3 comprises 14 interventions to reduce the harmful use of alcohol, \\nincluding three overarching/enabling policy actions, three “best buys”, two interventions \\nwith documented high effectiveness, and six other recommended interventions (Box 2.3). \\nAs described in Chapter 1, alcohol is a principal causal factor for a number of mental health \\nconditions, including alcohol dependence. The WHO mental health action plan 2013–2020 \\nacknowledges the role of alcohol use as a risk factor for mental health conditions and a \\nhigh level of comorbidity of severe mental disorders with alcohol and other substance \\nuse disorders, and reinforces the synergies in implementation of the mental health action \\nplan and the Global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol (WHO, 2013). \\nThe harmful use of alcohol is mentioned in numerous other global strategies and action \\nplans, but not at the level that is commensurate with the role of harmful use of alcohol in \\nsome major health and social challenges of modern societies. For example, the growing \\nevidence of a signiﬁcant contributing role of harmful use of alcohol to the disease burden \\nof tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis and sexually transmitted infections (Chapters 1 and 4) has \\nnot been yet been sufﬁciently recognized and addressed in the relevant global strategies \\nand action plans (WHO, 2015a; WHO, 2015b). \\n2.2 GLOBAL MONITORING FRAMEWORKS\\nLocal, national and international monitoring and surveillance frameworks are needed to \\nmonitor the magnitude and trends of alcohol consumption and related harm, as well as to \\nmonitor policy responses in conjunction with analysis of trends in alcohol consumption and \\nalcohol-attributable disease burden. This is critical for strengthening advocacy, adjusting \\npolicy and programme responses to the trends in alcohol-related harm and for assessing \\nthe impact of interventions. The ultimate goal of monitoring and surveillance is to provide, \\nin a timely manner, relevant and reliable information to policy-makers and decision-makers \\nfor ensuring effective prioritization, implementation and evaluation of policy options and \\ninterventions to reduce the harmful use of alcohol. With growing awareness of the impact \\nof alcohol consumption on global health and an increase in international frameworks for \\naction, as noted in section 2.1, the demand for global information on alcohol consumption \\nand alcohol-attributable and alcohol-related harm, as well as related policy responses, has \\nincreased signiﬁcantly.\\n'),\n",

The entries are sorted by the 10 alcohol policy areas and are \\naccessible by WHO region.\\nFinally, an archive was established to facilitate access to data that have been available on \\nGISAH previously.\\nGISAH serves as a repository for all key indicators presented in the country proﬁles and \\nadditional indicators included in the statistical annexes of the global status reports on \\nalcohol and health, as well as further data from passive surveillance of published and grey \\nliterature.

ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION\\nAlcohol is consumed worldwide but the majority of people in the world abstained from \\nalcohol in the past 12 months. Gender, age, health status, the economic wealth in a \\ncountry, lifestyle choices, religion and cultural norms have an impact on alcohol use. Such \\nfactors also inﬂuence the form in which alcohol is consumed. For instance, unrecorded \\nalcohol is often cheaper and therefore may be more produced and consumed in low-\\nincome countries. Some countries ban alcohol use, resulting in low alcohol per capita \\nconsumption and in unrecorded consumption accounting for a high share of overall alcohol \\nconsumption in a country. Worldwide, women are more often abstainers than men are, \\nand women who consume alcohol drink less than men do. This chapter reports on levels \\nand patterns of alcohol consumption, including abstention rates, in WHO regions and \\nthe world. Appendix IV contains a full list of WHO Member States by WHO region and \\nWorld Bank income group.\\n3.1 LEVELS OF CONSUMPTION\\nLevels of alcohol consumption can be measured using several indicators. One is the \\nprevalence (or the number) of current drinkers or abstainers in a country or region. Two \\nof the other most important and commonly used indicators are total alcohol per capita \\nconsumption in litres of pure alcohol per person per year and alcohol consumption in \\ngrams of pure alcohol per person per day; the latter indicator can be converted from the \\nprevious one for total population or estimated per capita for the drinking population only. \\nBox 3.1 contains a description of the indicators used in this report. \\nBox 3.1 Indicators of levels of alcohol consumption \\nCurrent drinkers: the percentage of those in the population aged 15 years and older who have \\nconsumed alcoholic beverages in the previous 12-month period. \\nTotal alcohol per capita consumption (APC) is deﬁned as the total (recorded plus estimated \\nunrecorded) alcohol per capita (i.e. persons aged 15 years and older) consumption within a \\ncalendar year in litres of pure alcohol, adjusted for tourist consumption. In this report this \\nindicator is used for the total population of 15 years and older (including non-drinkers) and for \\ncurrent drinkers only in the population. \\nGrams of pure ethanol per day is another often-used measure of alcohol consumption. In \\nthis report this indicator is used for the total population of 15 years and older (including non-\\ndrinkers) and for current drinkers only in the population. In particular, this measure is used by \\na number of countries that have set guidelines for daily limits on drinking to minimize health \\nand injury risks. Given the speciﬁc weight of alcohol of 0.793 g/cm3 (at 20°C), litres of pure \\nethanol per year can be converted into grams per day as follows:\\ng/day = APC x 1000 x 0.793 / 365 days.\\n'),\n",

In \\nthe Region of the Americas, former drinkers (29.0%) even outnumber lifetime abstainers \\n(16.9%). The percentage of former drinkers is an important indicator for monitoring trends \\nin alcohol consumption in populations.\\n3.1.2 Total alcohol per capita consumption (APC)\\nTotal APC comprises two components, namely the consumption of recorded and \\nunrecorded alcohol. Recorded alcohol is alcohol consumed as a beverage that is recorded \\nin ofﬁcial statistics, such as data on alcohol taxation or sales (see Appendix I for details \\nby country). A description of unrecorded alcohol is provided in Box 3.3. \\nBox 3.3 Unrecorded alcohol\\nUnrecorded alcohol refers to alcohol that is not accounted for in ofﬁcial statistics on \\nalcohol taxation or sales in the country where it is consumed because it is usually produced, \\ndistributed and sold outside the formal channels under government control. Unrecorded \\nalcohol consumption in a country includes consumption of homemade or informally produced \\nalcohol (legal or illegal), smuggled alcohol, alcohol intended for industrial or medical uses, and \\nalcohol obtained through cross-border shopping (which is recorded in a different jurisdiction). \\nSometimes these alcoholic beverages are traditional drinks that are produced and consumed \\nin the community or in homes. Home-made or informally-produced alcoholic beverages are \\nmostly fermented products made from sorghum, millet, maize, rice, wheat or fruits.\\nUnrecorded consumption also includes so-called surrogate alcohol, commonly ethanol that \\nwas not produced as beverage alcohol but is used as such (e.g. mouthwash, denatured \\nalcohol, medicinal tinctures, aftershaves and perfumes).\\nThere are different sources of data and various approaches to estimating unrecorded alcohol \\nconsumption, as discussed in Appendix IV.\\nAs shown by the most recent WHO data, total APC in the world’s population 15 years of \\nage or older amounts to drinking on average 6.4 litres of pure alcohol per year (see Table \\n3.2 for further details), which translates into 13.9 grams of pure alcohol per day. However, \\nthere is wide variation in total alcohol consumption across WHO regions (Table 3.2) and \\nMember States (Figure 3.3 and Appendix I for details by country). With a few exceptions \\nfrom countries in the WHO African Region (e.g. Nigeria), from the WHO Region of the \\nAmericas (e.g. Uruguay) or in Australia and New Zealand (Western Paciﬁc Region, or WPR), \\nthe highest per capita consumption of alcohol (10 litres or more) is observed in countries \\nof the WHO European Region. Relatively high (7.5–9.9 litres of pure alcohol per capita) \\nalcohol consumption levels are found mainly in high-income countries, particularly in the \\nWHO Region of the Americas and the Western Paciﬁc Region, but also in some countries \\nin the African Region. The world’s population with the lowest per capita consumption (less \\nthan 2.5 litres) lives in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region or in other Muslim-majority \\ncountries such as Niger in the WHO African Region, Indonesia in the WHO South-East \\nAsia Region (SEAR), or Azerbaijan in the WHO European Region.\\n'),\n",

However, there are diverging trends in different regions of the \\nworld. Most of the changes took place since 2005. Whereas in the WHO African Region, \\nthe Region of the Americas and the Eastern Mediterranean Region alcohol consumption \\nremained rather stable, in the European Region alcohol consumption decreased from 12.3 \\nlitres in 2005 to 9.8 litres in 2016. Although the sharpest decreases were found in the \\nformerly highest consuming countries such as the Russian Federation (from 18.7 litres in \\n2005 to 11.7 litres in 2016), the Republic of Moldova (from 21.6 litres in 2005 to 15.1 litres \\nin 2016) or Belarus (from 15.3 litres in 2005 to 11.2 litres in 2016), alcohol consumption \\ndecreased in almost three fourths of all countries in the WHO European Region. \\nAlcohol per capita consumption increased in the WHO Western Paciﬁc and South-East Asia \\nregions. These regions include the highly populated countries of China and India, which \\naccount for the increases (China: 4.1 litres, 7.1 litres and 7.2 litres in 2005, 2010 and 2016 \\nrespectively; India: 2.4 litres, 4.3 litres and 5.7 litres in 2005, 2010 and 2016 respectively). \\nFigure 3.5 Trends in total alcohol per capita consumption (APC) (15+ years) in litres of pure \\nalcohol in WHO regions, 2000−2016   \\n14.00\\nLitres of pure ethanol\\n12.00\\n10.00\\n8.00\\n6.00\\n4.00\\n2.00\\n AFR \\n AMR\\n EMR\\n EUR\\n SEAR\\n WPR\\n World\\n2000\\n6.2\\n8.2\\n0.4\\n12.1\\n2.4\\n4.8\\n5.7\\n2005\\n6.3\\n8.2\\n0.5\\n12.3\\n2.1\\n4.6\\n5.5\\n2010\\n6.3\\n8.2\\n0.6\\n11.2\\n3.5\\n7.0\\n6.4\\n2016\\n6.3\\n8.0\\n0.6\\n9.8\\n4.5\\n7.3\\n6.4\\n0.00\\n'),\n",

It is currently not expected that the increase in these \\nregions will be counterbalanced by substantial decreases in the other WHO regions, \\nwhere total alcohol per capita consumption will remain stable. Hence, APC is expected \\nto increase globally (from 6.4 to 7.0 litres).\\nThe highest increase is expected in the South-East Asia Region, with an increase of 2.2 \\nlitres alone in India which represents a large proportion of the total population in this \\nregion. However, increases, although smaller, are also expected in Indonesia and Thailand \\n(with the second- and fourth-largest largest populations). The second-highest increase \\nis projected for the populations of the Western Paciﬁc Region, where the population \\nof China is the largest, with an increase in per capita consumption of 0.9 litres of pure \\nalcohol by 2025. Other countries such as Viet Nam also have expected high increases (e.g. \\nmore than 3 litres for Viet Nam). However, high-income countries of the Western Paciﬁc \\nRegion, such as Australia and Japan, may decrease their per capita consumption. In the \\nRegion of the Americas there is variation in expected trends, but the three most populous \\ncountries – Brazil, Mexico and the USA – are predicted to increase alcohol consumption, \\nleading to an overall increase in this region. The increase in worldwide total APC is not \\ninﬂuenced by changes in the proportion of unrecorded consumption, which is projected \\nto increase slightly from 25.5% in 2016 to 27.7% in 2025.\\n'),\n",

HEALTH CONSEQUENCES\\nThe number of deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) (Box 4.1) caused and \\nprevented by alcohol were estimated by comparing the risks of mortality and morbidity \\nto these same risks under a counterfactual scenario in which there was no historical \\nconsumption of alcohol (i.e. the number of deaths and DALYs that would not have occurred \\nin the absence of alcohol consumption). \\nBox 4.1. Terminology related to burden of disease and injury \\nBurden of disease is deﬁned as the gap between current health status and an ideal situation in \\nwhich everyone lives to old age free of disease and disability. Premature death, disability and \\nrisks that contribute to illness and injury are the causes of this health gap. \\nDisability-adjusted life years (DALYs) represent a time-based measure of overall burden of \\ndisease for a given population. DALYs are the sum of years of life lost due to premature mortality \\nas well as years of life lost due to time lived in less than full health. \\nAlcohol-attributable deaths are deﬁned as the number of deaths attributable to alcohol \\nconsumption. They assume a counterfactual scenario of no alcohol consumption. Thus, \\nalcohol-attributable deaths are those deaths that would not have happened without the \\npresence of alcohol.\\nAge-standardized (or age-adjusted) alcohol-attributable deaths or DALY rates refer to a \\nweighted average of the age-speciﬁc death or DALY rates per 100 000 persons, where the \\nweights are the proportions of persons in the corresponding age groups of the WHO standard \\npopulation.\\nAlcohol-attributable fraction (AAF) is the proportion of all diseases and deaths that are \\nattributable to alcohol. AAFs are used to quantify the contribution of alcohol as a risk factor \\nto disease or death. AAFs can be interpreted as the proportion of deaths or burden of disease \\nwhich would disappear if there had not been any alcohol. AAFs are calculated on the basis \\nof the level of exposure to alcohol and the risk relations between the level of exposure and \\ndifferent disease categories.\\nTable 4.1 Causes of death and disability causally related to alcohol consumption \\nDiseases and injuries included in the analysis\\nDetrimental\\n \\nCommunicable, maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions\\n \\n \\nTuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, lower respiratory infections\\n \\nNoncommunicable diseases\\n \\n \\nLip and oral cavity, pharyngeal cancers (exluding nasopharyngeal), oesophagus cancer, colon and rectum cancers, liver  \\n \\n \\ncancer, breast cancer, larynx cancer, alcohol use disorders, epilepsy, hypertensive heart disease, haemorrhagic stroke,   \\n \\n \\nalcoholic cardiomyopathy, cirrhosis of the liver, pancreatitis \\n \\nInjuries\\n \\n \\nUnintentional injuries\\n \\n \\n Road injury, poisonings, falls, ﬁre, heat and hot substances, drowning, exposure to mechanical forces, other unintentional  \\n \\n \\n injuries\\n \\n \\nIntentional injuries\\n \\n \\n Self-harm, interpersonal violence\\nBeneﬁcial (at low levels of alcohol consumption*)\\n \\nNoncommunicable diseases\\n \\n \\nDiabetes mellitus, ischaemic heart disease, ischaemic stroke\\n* No health beneﬁt is seen for people who engage in binge drinking.\\nNot included in the analysis (however, alcohol has been shown to have an impact causally related to): major depressive disorder, atrial ﬁbrillation and ﬂutter, \\noesophageal varice, psoriasis.\\nFor the corresponding ICD-10 codes, the references used to assess causality and the relative risks used, see Table IV.8.\\n'),\n",

Furthermore, \\nthe estimates do not take into account the potential differential effects of having the A \\nallele variant ADH1Brs1229984 on the risk of having fatal coronary heart disease and/or \\nan ischaemic stroke (Holmes et al., 2014). Additionally, the chapter outlines the unequal \\neffects of alcohol consumption by geographical region, age, sex and economic status.\\n4.1 CHANGES IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE HEALTH \\nCONSEQUENCES OF ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION\\nThis chapter provides updated estimates of the number of alcohol-attributable deaths \\nand DALYs. Since the publication of the Global status report on alcohol and health 2014 \\n(WHO, 2014), additional evidence has been produced on the risk relationships between \\nalcohol consumption and the occurrence of diseases and injuries. The 2018 iteration of \\nthe Global status report on alcohol and health incorporates this new evidence on the risk \\nrelationships. First, recently-published meta-analyses update the relative risks used to \\nmodel the deaths and the burden of disease attributable to alcohol consumption (see \\nAppendix IV). Second, unlike the 2014 report, the 2018 Global status report on alcohol \\nand health includes the burden of disease caused by alcoholic cardiomyopathy (Manthey \\net al., 2018) which was not previously estimatable. Third, the effect of alcohol on the risk \\nof HIV/AIDS (Rehm et al., 2017b) was modelled on the effect of alcohol on the likelihood \\nto engage in unprotected sex as opposed to the effect of alcohol on adherence to taking \\nhighly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) (Hendershot et al., 2009). This latter method of \\nmodelling leads to the reporting of fewer alcohol-attributable HIV/AIDS deaths (Hendershot \\net al., 2009). Last, unlike the Global status report on alcohol and health 2014, the current \\nreport does not indicate the number of deaths from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD)/\\nfetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) as they are aggregated instead with alcohol use disorders \\n(AUDs), alcoholic myopathy and alcohol poisonings. \\nIn addition, the estimated burden of injuries caused by alcohol consumption includes \\nthe second-hand effects of consumption during pregnancy (limited to dysmorphic FAS) \\nand the results of motor vehicle accidents after alcohol consumption, but does not take \\ninto account the secondary effects of alcohol on assaults (i.e. the estimates are based \\non injuries to the drinker attributable to alcohol consumption). As a result, the alcohol-\\nattributable harms are underestimated, especially for women (alcohol contributes to \\ndomestic violence perpetrated against women) (Graham et al., 2008; Graham et al., 2011; \\nCherpitel et al., 2013) and for people under 15 years of age who do not consume alcohol \\nbut who are at risk of injuries from violence due to the drinking of others.\\nConsequently, the results of the analysis presented in this chapter underestimate the \\nburden of disease attributable to alcohol consumption, especially among people of \\nyounger age.\\n4.2 ALCOHOL-ATTRIBUTABLE MORTALITY AND THE BURDEN \\nOF DISEASE\\nThe harmful use of alcohol resulted in an estimated 3 million deaths (5.3% of all deaths) \\nglobally in 2016; these estimates incorporate both the detrimental and beneﬁcial health \\neffects of alcohol consumption. The effects of alcohol consumption on mortality are \\ngreater than those of tuberculosis (2.3%), HIV/AIDS (1.8%), diabetes (2.8%), hypertension \\n(1.6%), digestive diseases (4.5%), road injuries (2.5%) and violence (0.8%).\\n'),\n",

However, these effects overlap and therefore the AAFs can not be summed. For \\nexample, alcohol may play a role in a person becoming infected with HIV. Furthermore, \\nthis same person may have forgotten to take HAART due to alcohol consumption, leading \\nto their death from HIV/AIDS. Therefore, alcohol would be both indirectly and directly \\nresponsible for the same death, and therefore the two AAFs for HIV/AIDS cannot be \\nsummed as this would lead to double counting. Consequently, only the effect of alcohol \\nconsumption on the risk of unprotected sex was included when modelling the effect of \\nalcohol consumption on HIV/AIDS deaths and DALYs as this AAF is greater than the AAF \\nfor HIV/AIDS deaths and DALYs caused by a lower adherence to HAART.\\n4.2.2 The alcohol-attributable burden of noncommunicable diseases\\nBecause of global population ageing, NCDs are now a major focus of national and global \\npreventative efforts, with alcohol being considered one of the four key risk factors which \\ncontribute to this burden (Lutz, Sanderson & Scherbov, 2008; UN, 2016; WHO, 2013). \\nThe WHO Global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases \\n2013–2020 focuses on cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic lung diseases and \\ndiabetes. The analysis of alcohol-attributable burden of NCDs also includes the impact \\nof alcohol on digestive diseases and mental, neurological and substance use disorders \\nwhere a signiﬁcant portion of the disability is due to alcohol consumption (Hay et al., 2017; \\nWhiteford et al., 2013). Alcohol consumption caused an estimated 1.7 million NCD deaths \\n(4.3% of all NCD deaths) and 65.5 million NCD DALYs (4.2% of all NCD DALYs) in 2016.\\n4.2.2.1 Malignant neoplasms\\nCancer is a leading cause of death in both low-income and high-income countries (Torre \\net al., 2015), and the burden of cancer is expected to increase, especially in developing \\ncountries (where the majority of the world’s population lives) due to population ageing \\nas well as shifts in lifestyle and environmental risks as countries develop (Bray & \\nSoerjomataram, 2015). The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has \\ndetermined that alcohol consumption is causally related to oral cavity, oropharyngeal, \\nhypopharyngeal, oesophageal (squamous cell carcinoma), colon, rectal, laryngeal, liver \\n'),\n",

The measurement of \\nalcohol poisoning deaths may be affected by the miscoding of alcohol poisonings as \\ncardiovascular diseases (Whiteford et al., 2013); however, the miscoding of alcohol \\npoisonings appears to be limited to the former Soviet Union (Zaridze et al., 2008). These \\npoisonings do not include the poisonings which result from impurities found in alcoholic \\nbeverages – such as methanol, acetaldehyde, higher alcohols and toxic metals (Paasma \\net al., 2007; Solodun et al., 2011; Rehm, Kanteres & Lachenmeier, 2010); however, the \\ndeaths caused by these poisonings are thought to be relatively small in comparison to \\nthe burden of disease attributable to alcohol consumption (Rehm et al., 2017a; Zakharov \\net al., 2014; Lachenmeier & Rehm, 2009; Rostrup et al., 2016).\\n4.2.2.4 Epilepsy and other neuropsychiatric disorders  \\nOf the 137 000 epilepsy deaths and 14.7 million epilepsy DALYs, an estimated 17 000 \\nepilepsy deaths and 1.5 million epilepsy DALYs were attributed to alcohol, representing \\n12.7% of all deaths and 10.2% of all DALYs due to epilepsy.

However, because there is insufﬁcient epidemiological \\nresearch involving the prospective measurement of the risk differences in the occurrence \\nof major depressive disorders in persons who consume different amounts of alcohol, the \\nhealth burden of major depressive disorders caused by alcohol was not tabulated for this \\nreport. The relationship between alcohol and the onset of major depressive disorders is \\nalso due, in part, to 1) alcohol consumption leading to depression,and 2) persons with \\ndepressive disorders being more likely to consume alcohol in larger volumes and in more \\ndetrimental patterns – i.e. the “self-medication” hypothesis (Bolton, Robinson & Sareen, \\n2009) the possibility of underlying genetic vulnerabilities that affect both the risk of \\ndepression and alcohol consumption.

In particular, \\nthe risk of mortality from alcohol consumption is responsible for recent stagnations, and \\neven decreases, in life expectancies in developed countries; the risk is due, in part, to \\nan increased rate of deaths from injuries which occur at younger ages (Olshansky et al., \\n2005; Fenelon, Chen & Baker, 2016; Kochanek, Arias & Bastian, 2016). This is a particularly \\nimportant factor to consider when developing and implementing alcohol policies because \\nalcohol is responsible for 17.6% of all injury deaths globally.\\nGlobally in 2016, alcohol was responsible for 7.2% of all premature mortality (i.e. \\ndeaths among persons 69 years of age and younger). People of younger ages were \\ndisproportionately affected by alcohol when compared to people of older ages, with the \\nproportion of all deaths attributable to alcohol consumption being greatest among those \\nwho are 20–39 years of age; 13.5% of all deaths among these persons (i.e 578 000 \\ndeaths) were attributable to alcohol consumption (Figure 4.17). The proportion of deaths \\nattributable to alcohol consumption by age also varied by WHO region. While in most \\nregions the proportion of deaths attributable to alcohol consumption was highest among \\npeople of 20–34 years of age, in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (1.1% of all deaths), \\npeople 45–49 years of age had the highest proportion of deaths attributable to alcohol \\nconsumption (1.6% of all deaths).

The distribution of alcohol-attributable diseases and injuries is due, in part, \\nto the fact that men consume more alcohol than women do. Furthermore, men have a \\nhigher risk of diseases and outcomes related to alcohol consumption due to engaging in \\nother risk behaviours related to heavy alcohol consumption and binge drinking, such as \\nsmoking tobacco and consuming tobacco products (Gubner, Delucchi & Ramo, 2016; De \\nLeon et al., 2007), poor diet (Fawehinmi et al., 2012) and being obese (French et al., 2010).\\nThe causes of alcohol-attributable deaths and DALYs also varied by sex.

Socioeconomic differences in the impact of \\nalcohol on mortality may be explained, in part, by the effect of socioeconomic status on \\nthe volume, patterns and context in which alcohol is consumed (Hamdi, Krueger & South, \\n2015), on access to quality health care (Adler & Newman, 2002) and on the clustering \\nof risk factors which affect similar diseases – such as smoking, obesity and sedentary \\nlifestyles – which, if they occur together, may have multiplicative effects on health, \\nleading to a higher impact of alcohol on the health of people with lower socioeconomic \\nstatuses (Bellis et al., 2016). Observational studies have identiﬁed a socioeconomic \\ngradient between risk factors which are related to alcohol consumption – including \\nsmoking, fruit and vegetable intake, obesity and physical inactivity (Bellis et al., 2016; \\nHosseinpoor et al., 2012; Stringhini et al., 2017; Allen et al., 2017; Sommer et al., 2015); \\nhowever, these studies originate from developed countries and results may not be the \\nsame in lower-income countries. The risk relationship between alcohol consumption \\nand tobacco (although not modelled in this chapter because of the lack of global data on \\nthe co-occurrence of both alcohol consumption and tobacco smoking) increases the risk \\nof head and neck cancers, with alcohol acting as a solvent for the carcinogens found in \\ntobacco smoke (Dal Maso et al., 2016). However, the risk relationships between these \\nfactors are not well described and, although many studies have modelled these risk \\nrelationships as multiplicative, they may be additive. Furthermore, after controlling for body \\nmass index and smoking status, it has been observed that people of low socioeconomic \\nstatus are twice as likely to die from an alcohol-attributable cause compared to people of \\nhigh socioeconomic status (Katikireddi et al., 2017).\\n'),\n",

ALCOHOL POLICY AND \\nINTERVENTIONS\\nHarmful alcohol use is among the leading preventable risk factors for physical and social \\nharms globally. Alcohol policies are laws, rules, and regulations that aim to prevent and \\nreduce alcohol-related harms (Babor, 2010; WHO, 2010). Alcohol policies can exist at the \\nglobal, regional, international, national or subnational levels. Effective alcohol strategies \\nincorporate a multilevel, multicomponent approach, targeting multiple determinants \\nof drinking and alcohol-related harms, such as availability, price, marketing and drink–\\ndriving. After Member States have formulated alcohol policies, the policies must be well \\nimplemented, enforced and evaluated in order to be effective (Jones-Webb et al., 2014). \\nThis chapter focuses on national alcohol policies and presents the information collected \\nfrom WHO Member States during the WHO Global Survey on Alcohol and Health 2016. \\nThe information is presented according to the 10 recommended target areas for policy \\naction at national level proposed in WHO’s Global strategy to reduce the harmful use of \\nalcohol (hereafter referred to as the “Global strategy”), endorsed by the World Health \\nAssembly in 2010 (WHO, 2010) with a focus on the most cost-effective interventions \\n(“best buys”) included in the Global action plan for the prevention and control of NCDs \\n2013–2020 (WHO, 2017a) (see Chapter 2). Throughout the chapter, there are boxes \\ncontaining speciﬁc examples that illustrate national alcohol policies and interventions.\\nSome countries have implemented a total ban on alcohol, such that residents of the \\ncountry are not permitted to purchase or consume alcohol. The Global Survey on Alcohol \\nand Health 2016 shows that 11 countries have a total ban on alcohol. These countries’ \\nresponses are included with regard to leadership, awareness and commitment; health \\nservices’ response; drink–driving policies and countermeasures; and illicit and informal \\nalcohol. Their responses are excluded from the other sections.\\nIn 2016, 173 of 194 WHO Member States responded to the Global Survey on Alcohol and \\nHealth, resulting in a 89% response rate. This response rate is similar to that of the 2012 \\nsurvey (177 out of 196 countries, or 91%) and 2008 (162 out of 193 countries, or 84%). \\nTrend analyses use only those data from the 148 countries (76%) that responded to the \\nGlobal Survey of Alcohol and Health in all three years (2008, 2012 and 2016), and each \\nquestion uses only data from countries that answered for all three years.\\n5.1 SITUATION ANALYSIS\\n5.1.1 Leadership, awareness and commitment\\nWHO Member States must demonstrate leadership and generate appropriate awareness \\nof the burden of alcohol use in order to meaningfully and sustainably reduce the harms \\nfrom alcohol consumption (WHO, 2010). Ideally, Member States should document their \\ncommitment with adequately-funded, intersectoral national policies, and these policies \\nshould have clear objectives, strategies, targets and divisions of responsibility (WHO, \\n2010). The Global Survey on Alcohol and Health 2016 reported on two indicators of \\nleadership, awareness and commitment, namely 1) the development of national written \\nalcohol policies and 2) the presence of awareness-raising activities. \\n'),\n",

An additional eight countries (5%) had subnational policies and 11 others \\n(6%) had a total ban on alcohol. The Global strategy states that all WHO Member States \\nwill beneﬁt from a national alcohol strategy, regardless of their level of resources (WHO, \\n2010). However, the presence of a written national alcohol policy has risen with national \\nincome levels: 34 high-income countries (67%), 23 upper-middle-income countries (43%), \\n18 lower-middle-income countries (42%) and four low-income countries (15%) reported \\nhaving a written national policy on alcohol. \\nNote: The numbers in each coloured bar indicate the number of countries in that category, whereas the length of each coloured bar indicates the percentage of \\ncountries in the category.\\n100\\nPercentage (%) of countries\\nAFR\\nAMR\\nEMR\\nEUR\\nSEAR\\nWPR\\nWorld\\nWHO Region\\n Yes, written national policy      No, but have written or subnational policy/policies      No, no national policy      Total alcohol ban\\nFigure 5.1 Presence of a written national alcohol policy by WHO region and percentage (in %) of \\ncountries, 2016\\n(n = 175 reporting countries)\\n90\\n80\\n70\\n60\\n50\\n40\\n30\\n20\\n10\\n0\\n11\\n76\\n8\\n80\\n4\\n13\\n1\\n2\\n1\\n5\\n1\\n30\\n2\\n14\\n12\\n3\\n37\\n9\\n5\\n3\\n23\\n2\\n8\\nThe good news is that most (66%) of the 80 responding countries with a national alcohol \\npolicy reported having government funding for national policy implementation.

However, a small \\nminority adopted their policies through the Ministry of Health (11%) or through another \\nministry (3%).

In the 2011 Global status report on alcohol and health, Russia was shown as \\nhaving a per capita consumption of 15.8 litres per person, which was the fourth highest in the \\nEuropean Region (WHO, 2011b). This harmful consumption pattern contributed substantially \\nto high levels of morbidity and mortality, including alcohol-attributable deaths (Nemtsov, 2002; \\nLeon et al., 2007), cancer (World Bank, 2005), violence (World Bank, 2005; WHO Regional Ofﬁce \\nfor Europe, 2006), alcohol poisoning (World Bank, 2005) and alcohol use disorders (World \\nBank, 2005).\\nTo combat these harms, Russia implemented a series of evidence-based national alcohol \\npolicies in a stepwise manner within a comprehensive framework (WHO, 2017b). In 2005, \\nRussia implemented a federal alcohol control law and, ﬁve years later, adopted a national \\nprogramme of actions to reduce alcohol-related harm through to 2020 (WHO, 2017b). These \\ntwo documents formed the backbone for subsequent policy measures (see the ﬁgure below). \\nThe new policies spanned many of the action areas outlined in the Global strategy, with a \\nfocus on the three “best buys”. \\nAs a result of these coordinated actions, total per capita alcohol consumption in the Russian \\nFederation fell by 3.5 litres over a 9-year period (2007–2016) (WHO, 2017b).

Thailand’s per capita alcohol consumption among adults \\nskyrocketed from 0.3 litres per year in 1961 to 8.5 litres per year in 2001 (WHO, 2014b; Institute \\nof Alcohol Studies, 2017). With current per capita consumption at 7.2 litres, Thailand has the \\nhighest per capita consumption in WHO’s South-East Asia Region (6.4 litres) (Waleewong, \\n2017). This consumption leads to consequences such as drink–driving, interpersonal violence, \\nand alcohol consumption during pregnancy (Waleewong, 2017). In addition, 82% of the \\npopulation report experiencing harm from someone else’s drinking (Waleewong et al., 2015). \\nIn Thailand, the likelihood of domestic violence increases fourfold when one person drinks, \\nand two in ﬁve crimes committed by young people involve alcohol (Department of Child and \\nAdolescent Correction and Protection, 2008).\\nThailand has managed to slow the rise in alcohol consumption and address the harmful use \\nof alcohol through the “triangle that moves the mountain” (Waleewong, 2017). The three legs \\nof this “triangle” are strong scientiﬁc communities, energetic grassroots movements and \\nevidence-based policies. \\nThailand has been particularly innovative with regard to alcohol taxation, structuring its \\ntaxes to account for problems speciﬁc to low- and middle-income settings. Speciﬁc taxes \\nare one common type of alcohol excise tax, with the level of these taxes based on the volume \\nof the alcohol content of the beverage. Speciﬁc taxes favour consumption of low-alcohol \\nalternatives, an appropriate step in high-income settings with high prevalence of alcohol \\nconsumption (Babor, 2010). However, speciﬁc taxes may inadvertently encourage drinking \\ninitiation among young people in low- and middle-income settings, where young people often \\nstart their drinking careers with cheap, low-alcohol beverages. Thailand’s solution to this \\ndilemma was the “two-chosen-one” (or 2C1) taxation design. This taxation method “calculates \\nthe excise tax of each alcoholic beverage using both primary taxation methods – speciﬁc and \\nad valorem; the excise tax on the beverage is then determined to be the higher of the two \\ncalculations” (Sornpaisarn, Shield & Rehm, 2012). \\nA timeline of key events in Thailand’s alcohol policy development since 2000 appears below.\\n2001\\n2008\\n2009\\n2010\\n2012\\n2013\\n2015\\n2017\\nPassed Alcohol Beverage \\nControl Act, including:\\n• ban on direct \\nadvertising and \\npromotions\\n• minimum legal \\ndrinking age of 18 \\nyears\\n• new warning labels \\n• restriction on hours \\nand days of sale\\nAdded a 2% surcharge \\nto the alcohol and \\ntobacco excise tax, the \\nproceeds of which fund \\nthe ThaiHealth Promotion \\nFoundation (ThaiHealth)\\nThai National Health \\nAssembly adopted a \\nnational strategic plan \\nand prohibited alcohol \\nsales on Buddhist \\nholidays\\nRegulations on alcohol \\nlogos\\nProhibited sales and \\ndrinking in factories, \\npublic organizations, \\nstate enterprises, road/\\npavement, and in cars\\nProhibited alcohol sales \\nand drinking in public \\nparks\\nIncreased alcohol excise \\ntax by 2% and lowered \\nBAC limit for young \\ndrivers to 0.02%\\nAmendments to Alcohol \\nBeverage Control Act, \\nincluding:\\n• prohibiting sales within \\n300 metres of higher \\neducation buildings\\n•limiting hours of sale to \\n11 AM – 2:00 PM and \\n5:00 PM to 12:00 AM\\n'),\n",

In particular, community action can build on local knowledge \\nto tailor tactics to cultural norms, beliefs and value systems to inﬂuence group behaviours \\n(WHO, 2010). WHO recommends conducting rapid assessments to identify community \\ngaps and priorities, increasing identiﬁcation of alcohol-related harms and evidence-based \\nstrategies, supporting local authorities’ coordination to reduce harmful use of alcohol, \\nand providing information and support for persons affected by harmful use of alcohol \\n(WHO, 2010).\\nCommunity actions tend to be highly acceptable to policy-makers and the public as a \\nstrategy. There is evidence that suggests that community action is an effective approach \\nto reduce alcohol-related problems (Perry et al., 1996; Wagenaar et al., 2000), particularly \\nin high-income countries and among young people (Babor, 2010). These actions can \\ninspire stakeholders to support and implement alcohol control measures in ways that are \\nappropriate to local cultural norms, beliefs and values (Babor, 2010).\\nNonetheless, community action is one of the most commonly reported interventions for \\nreducing the harmful use of alcohol.

Sobriety checkpoints can use \\neither selective breath-testing (i.e. testing the BAC of drivers who are suspected to be \\ndriving under the inﬂuence of alcohol) or random breath-testing (i.e. stopping and testing \\na random selection of drivers for BAC levels). Multiple systematic reviews support using \\nsobriety checkpoints to reduce drink–driving harms (Bergen et al., 2014; Shults et al., \\n2001; Peek-Asa, 1999). It is estimated that these checkpoints can reduce fatal driving \\ncrashes by about 20% if they are publicized, highly visible and frequently used. Based on \\nthis evidence, WHO recommends establishing BAC limits (with lower limits for novice \\nand professional drivers), promoting sobriety checkpoints and random breath-testing, \\nadministrative suspension of licences, graduated driving licences for novice drivers, and \\nignition interlocks to reduce alcohol-impaired driving (WHO, 2010).\\nImplementation of drink–driving policies were also common among reporting countries. \\nOne hundred and ﬁfty-ﬁve countries (89%) indicated that they had some type of drink–\\ndriving legislation, while 20 (11%) reported no drink–driving legislation, including seven \\nof the 11 countries with a total ban on alcohol. The Global Survey on Alcohol and Health \\n2016 included three indicators of drink–driving policies and countermeasures: BAC limits \\nset at the national level for the general population, for young persons and for operators of \\ncommercial vehicles; drink–driving prevention measures; and penalties for drink–driving.\\n5.1.4.1 Blood alcohol concentration limits\\nData on the maximum permissible BAC at the national level were available from 171 \\nresponding countries, including two countries with subnational policies. The Global \\nstrategy cites strong evidence in support of a low BAC limit (between 0.02% and 0.05%), \\nand the majority of responding countries (70%) with an established BAC limit set at or \\nbelow 0.05%. The most common maximum permissible BAC for drivers in the general \\npopulation is 0.05% (51 responding countries), with 0.08% (37 responding countries) \\nbeing the second most frequent (Figure 5.5). Fifteen countries reported zero as the \\nmaximum permissible BAC at the national level for drivers – in effect a ban on any level of \\nalcohol detectable by routine methods for drivers in the general population.

To combat these harms, Brazil lowered the maximum \\npermissible blood alcohol concentration limit to almost zero in 2013 (penalties apply if a driver’s \\nBAC is greater than 0.05%, based on the margin of error in the test). This law was coupled with \\nsevere sanctions, including a R$ 1915 (approximately US$ 1000) ﬁne and suspension of licence \\nfor 12 months for drivers caught violating the law. However, awareness of the new law and \\naccompanying sanctions was low, especially among Brazilians who drink and drive.\\n“Vida Urgente” is a community-based drink–driving campaign developed by the Thiago de \\nMoraes Gonzaga Foundation, an organization that aims to promote awareness in ways that \\ncan facilitate behaviour change. This campaign is centered on Porto Alegre, which is the \\ncapital and largest city in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul. Research on reducing \\nthe risk of drink–driving requested by the Thiago de Moraes Gonzaga Foundation from the \\nCatholic University of Rio Grande do Sul found that 85% of young people think applications are \\nthe best way to help them get home safely after drinking (Gonzaga, 2018). As a result (Gonzaga, \\n2018), Vide Urgente partnered with a taxi service to help facilitate safe alternatives to drinking \\nand driving.\\nOne way in which Vida Urgente helps link drinkers to the taxi service is through their signature \\nblitzes, in which groups of volunteers perform in ways that highlight the preciousness of life \\nand help bystanders consider their roles as pedestrians, drivers and passengers. Volunteers \\ntake the stage with high-energy performances while their colleagues circulate the crowd, \\noffering breathalyzer tests and drawings for taxi service codes to travel home safely (Thiago \\nde Moraes Gonzaga Foundation, 2018).\\nVida Urgente had an impressive success during Carnival, one of the biggest Brazilian festivals, \\nan event that is often marked by high rates of trafﬁc crash fatalities (Gonzaga, 2018). During \\nthe “Buzoom” event, the campaign provided buses to transport more than 5000 young people \\nbetween parties (Gonzaga, 2018). There was not a single road trafﬁc fatality on the major \\nroads near Carnival in Porto Alegre in the years that Buzoom was in place (Gonzaga, 2018). \\nThis inspiring feat helped the project win a national award offered by an international vehicle \\nmanufacturer (Gonzaga, 2018).\\nThe Vida Urgente campaign has helped Porto Alegre achieve sizeable reductions in trafﬁc \\ncrash fatalities. The number of deaths from trafﬁc crashes per 100 000 population is much lower \\nin Porto Alegre (7.0) than Rio Grande do Sul (14.9) and Brazil as a whole (23.4) (WHO, 2010).\\nResearch has estimated that countries experience a decrease in fatal and injury crashes \\nof between 5% and 18% after reducing their BAC limit from 0.08% to 0.05%. In general, \\nlow-income countries have tended to lag behind the other countries in implementing lower \\nBAC limits for drivers. Almost half (48%) of responding low-income countries did not have \\nan established BAC limit for the general population. Among the low-income countries with \\nestablished limits, 57% were at the 0.08% level, which was the most lenient standard \\nreported. At the other end of the income spectrum, 82% of high-income countries had a \\nnational BAC limit at or below 0.05%. \\nLower maximum permissible BAC limits for commercial or novice drivers were more \\ncommon (Figure 5.6). Thirty-six responding countries set a lower BAC limit for commercial \\ndrivers than for the general population. More than half (58%) of established BAC limits \\nfor commercial drivers were at or below 0.05%, including 28 countries (16%) with \\n'),\n",

The deﬁnition used for \\nrandom breath-testing was “that any driver can be stopped by the police at any time to \\ntest the breath for alcohol consumption”. Forty-ﬁve responding countries (26%) reported \\nconducting random breath tests at roadside checkpoints but not sobriety checkpoints, \\nwhile 19 responding countries (11%) had sobriety checkpoints but did not use random \\nbreath-testing (Figure 5.7).

Countries without a \\nlegal minimum purchase age tended to be low-income or lower-middle-income; the \\ngreatest number of countries without such a policy was in the WHO African Region. \\nEight countries without a minimum legal purchase age for on-premise beer sales in 2012 \\nreported one in 2016.

Among those who consume alcohol, nearly one in two men (48.1%) and two in ﬁve \\nwomen (41.2%) engage in heavy episodic drinking (WHO, 2011b). South African adults aged 15 \\nyears and older consume an average of 9.5 litres each year, which is substantially higher than \\nthe African regional average of 6.2 litres per person (WHO, 2011b). This pattern of consumption \\nresults in high levels of alcohol-related harms, including interpersonal violence, trafﬁc crashes \\nand HIV/AIDS. \\nOne of the most challenging problems with controlling the physical availability of alcohol in \\nSouth Africa was inheriting thousands of unlicensed bars/pubs (called shebeens) after the \\nfall of Apartheid. During Apartheid, non-white South Africans were prohibited from entering \\nbars/pubs or selling alcohol themselves, so unlicensed shebeens sprang up as an alternative. \\nWithout oversight, shebeens were often open late into the night and they were the site of violent \\nacts and risky sexual behaviours. To address this problem, the Liquor Amendment Bill proposes \\nprohibiting licensed distributors from selling alcohol to unlicensed establishments. Under this \\nnew legislation, these producers could be held liable for any damages caused by their products. \\nIn addition, the Liquor Product Amendment Bill proposes broadening the classiﬁcations of \\nregulated alcohol to include all beers and fermented beverages, casting them under the \\nauthority of the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Business Tech, 2018).\\nIn addition to targeted regulation of shebeens, the proposed legislation also includes \\ncomprehensive availability restrictions to restrict trading hours and days, increase the minimum \\nlegal purchase age from 18 to 21 years and prohibit alcohol sales within 500 metres of sensitive \\nlocations (e.g. places of worship, schools, recreational facilities and treatment centres, among \\nothers) (Republic of South Africa, 2016).\\n'),\n",

Witnesses reported that the rioters were under the inﬂuence of \\nalcohol and threw beer bottles and other objects at ofﬁcers and medical personnel as they tried \\nto extract the victim and the bus driver from the scene (Armstrong & Ng, 2014; FC, 2013). Ofﬁcers \\nfrom the police and Special Operations Command were called to the scene and dispersed the \\ncrowd after approximately two hours of rioting (FC, 2013).\\nFollowing the riot in the Little India area, the Singapore government implemented the Public Order \\n(Additional Temporary Measures) Act to ban alcohol sales and public consumption in Little India \\n(Sim, 2013; Sim, 2014). The subsequent Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Act, enacted in \\nresponse to the riot (Ong, 2016), extended an existing ban on public drunkenness with the limits \\non alcohol sales and consumption implemented in Little India to prevent amenity harms (e.g. \\npublic disorder, vandalism and petty crimes) throughout Singapore (Sim, 2014). The Parliament \\npassed the Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Act in January 2015, and it went into effect \\nin April of that year (Singapore Police Force, 2017; Republic of Singapore, 2015). Under this new \\nlaw, people are prohibited from drinking in all public places (i.e. locations with free access) from \\n22:30 until 07:00 the next morning (called the “no-public drinking period”) (Republic of Singapore, \\n2015). Off-premise retail alcohol outlets (i.e. outlets that sell alcohol for patrons to consume off-\\nsite) are also prohibited from selling alcohol during these hours (Republic of Singapore, 2015). \\nPeople may continue to drink alcohol in their homes or in on-premise alcohol outlets (e.g. bars \\nand restaurants) during the no-public drinking period (Han, 2015b).\\nThe new act includes penalties for infringements that are similar to the penalties for public \\ndrunkenness (1997). A ﬁrst offence carries a ﬁne of up to S$ 1000 and persons who violate \\nthe law repeatedly can receive ﬁnes of up to S$ 2000 or up to three months of imprisonment \\n(Republic of Singapore, 2015). Retail stores caught selling alcohol during these prohibited hours \\ncan be ﬁned up to S$ 10 000 (Republic of Singapore, 2015).\\nThere are also more stringent regulations and sanctions for two areas – Geylang and Little \\nIndia – where levels of excessive alcohol consumption and the risk of public disorder were \\ndeemed to be higher (Republic of Singapore, 2015; Han, 2015a). Drinking in public in these \\n“liquor control zones” is banned from 07:00 on Saturday through to 07:00 on Monday (Republic \\nof Singapore, 2015). In addition, the penalties are increased by 150% if the ban is violated in one \\nof these liquor control zones (Republic of Singapore, 2015).\\n'),\n",

Options for reporting \\nincluded no restrictions, voluntary codes or self-regulation, partial bans and total bans \\nacross all media types. In this report, marketing restrictions are described in detail for \\nbeer only; however, the restrictions across media types were consistent for wine and \\nspirits, and the relevant information is available online in GISAH.\\nBox 5.6 Finland’s ban on alcohol-branded social media communication\\nSince Finland changed its alcohol laws in 1995 to permit alcohol advertising, it has progressively \\nintroduced stricter restrictions on alcohol advertising practices (Tuominen, 2015; Montonen, \\n2017). The 1995 laws initially banned advertising for the most harmful products – strong \\nalcoholic beverages, or beverages with more than 22% absolute alcohol (Tuominen, 2015). In \\n2008, Finland limited the time and placement of alcohol advertisements by banning advertising \\non television from 07:00 to 19:00 and in cinemas (except for X-rated movies) to reduce young \\npeople’s exposure to alcohol advertising (Tuominen, 2015). Again aiming to curb youth \\nexposure to alcohol advertisements, Finland became one of the ﬁrst countries to ban alcohol \\nadvertisements in social media in 2015 (Tuominen, 2015).\\nFinland’s social media ban prohibits advertisements and promotions that 1) involve games, \\nlotteries or contests or 2) involve information networking service activity of textual or visual \\ncontent produced by consumers or any such content produced by a commercial actor and \\nintended to be shared by consumers. For example, competitions and prizes on Facebook, \\nallowing people to share posts on their Facebook page, or producing viral videos intended \\nto be shared on social media sites are all banned. In the context of a transnational alcohol \\nindustry, the Finnish regulations prohibit commercial actors from targeting Finnish persons \\nwith interactive alcohol advertisements even from outside Finland. However, these regulations \\npermit conventional alcohol advertising online and do not apply to consumers’ personal social \\nmedia pages (Tuominen, 2015).\\nSince Finland enacted this ban, several other countries in the Nordic-Baltic region have followed \\nsuit. In 2018, Lithuania enacted a comprehensive alcohol advertising ban that included digital \\nmedia (Law on Alcohol Control, 2018), and Estonia is considering similar measures (Alcohol \\nIreland, 2017). In addition, a white paper was presented to the Parliament in Sweden on how to \\nprotect children and young people from online advertising (EUCAM, 2018).\\nFigure 5.12 shows the prevalence of restrictions on advertising for beer by media type. \\nSeveral countries have adopted advertising restrictions since 2012, and the majority \\nof responding countries now have some type of restriction for all media types except \\nInternet (48%) and social media (47%). Total bans were most common for national \\ntelevision (26%) and national radio (26%). As in 2012, the greatest number of countries \\nreported no restrictions on the Internet and social media, suggesting that regulation in \\nmany countries continues to lag behind technological innovation in marketing. In 2016, \\n123 countries reported on alcohol marketing restrictions across all media and beverage \\ntypes. Of these countries, 51 (41%) had total bans for all media types and 35 (28%) had \\nno regulations on any media type. Most of the countries that reported no restrictions \\nacross all media types were located in the African (17 responding countries) or Americas \\nregions (11 responding countries).\\n'),\n",

The strategy also \\nencourages countries to review prices regularly in relation to inﬂation and income levels; \\nto ban or restrict sales below cost and other price promotions; and to establish minimum \\nprices for alcohol where applicable (WHO, 2010).\\nBox 5.8 Botswana’s increasing excise taxes\\nSince attaining independence in 1966, Botswana has had a drinking pattern marked by high \\nlevels of both abstention and heavy episodic drinking. With HIV/AIDS prevalence rates as high \\nas 18%, the National AIDS Coordinating Agency (NACA) developed a position paper in 2002 \\nlinking alcohol with HIV infection. The following year, national frameworks identiﬁed alcohol \\nintoxication as a risk factor for exposure to HIV, and alcohol continues to be an obstacle to \\neffective HIV prevention efforts (Sinkamba, 2015).\\nAlcohol excise duties were ﬁrst developed through the Southern African Customs Union (SACU). \\nAfter a long history without formal alcohol policies at the national level, the Ministry of Trade \\nand Industry in Botswana prepared a regulatory framework referred to as Liquor Regulations in \\n2005 (Pitso & Obot, 2011). Three years later, tax levies were introduced in the Control of Goods \\n(Intoxicating Liquor Levy) Regulations, 2008 (Pitso & Obot, 2011). These regulations proposed \\na 70% alcohol levy on all domestically produced intoxicating liquors, with the aim of reducing \\nconsumption speciﬁcally among young people (Lucas, 2008; Sinkamba, 2015). At the same \\ntime, revenue collected from the levy would be invested in efforts to reduce the harmful use \\nof alcohol and minimize its negative consequences (Sinkamba, 2015). In response, the alcohol \\nindustry argued that the levy had made imported alcohol more affordable than domestic alcohol, \\ncausing a shift in consumer preferences, and that the regulations would thus result in harm to \\nthe business sector and job losses (Pitso & Obot, 2011; Burgis, 2009). As a result, the levy was \\nreduced to 30% (Burgis, 2009). However, the alcohol tax was increased to 40% two years \\nlater under the Levy on Alcohol Beverages Fund (Amendment) Order, 2010 (Sebego et al., 2014). \\nTrafﬁc crash rates fell by 12% seven months after the ﬁrst alcohol excise tax and by another \\n12% ﬁve months after the 2010 levy increase; however, other changes were made during this \\ntime so the authors were unable to attribute these full decreases to the taxes (Sebego et al., \\n2014).\\nBotswana increased the alcohol levy by a further 10% to reach 55% in 2015 to prevent the \\nincidence and consequences of alcohol abuse (Matumo, 2015). This measure also increased \\nthe scope of the tax to include imported alcoholic beverages and production costs for the ﬁrst \\ntime (Matumo, 2015).\\nPrice policies are the most cost-effective WHO best buy for reducing the burden of \\nharmful alcohol use. Figure 5.16 shows that almost all of the responding countries (95%) \\nhave alcohol excise taxes; however, fewer than half of the countries use the other price \\nstrategies highlighted in the Global strategy – such as adjusting taxes to keep up with \\ninﬂation and income levels, imposing minimum pricing policies, or banning below-cost \\nselling or volume discounts. \\n'),\n",

Of the 65 responding countries requiring either warning \\nlabels on advertisements for alcohol and/or on alcohol bottles or containers, 23 have a \\nlegal requirement regarding the size of the warning label. Warning labels often focus on \\nunderage drinking (41 countries) or drink–driving (31 countries) (Box 5.9). Only seven \\ncountries require rotation of the warning label text.\\nBox 5.9 Examples of warning texts on alcoholic beverage labels\\nThe warning messages countries place on alcohol advertisements and bottles vary across the \\nworld, though most include a broad statement about negative health effects that may result from \\nalcohol consumption – such as the USA’s “may cause health effects” or Gabon’s “alcohol is \\ndangerous for health”. \\nMessages on warning labels frequently focus speciﬁcally on drink–driving and drinking during \\npregnancy. For instance, Ethiopia has warning labels that read, “don’t drink if you drive”, while \\nKenya’s labels state, “excessive alcohol consumption impairs your judgement; do not drive or \\noperate machinery”. Panama and Sweden take a slightly different approach, with “driving under \\nthe inﬂuence of alcohol increases the risk of accidents” and “one in two drivers killed in single \\naccidents is intoxicated by alcohol”, respectively. Pregnancy-focused warning labels include \\nAlbania’s “drinking can harm your unborn baby” and Kenya’s “alcohol consumption when \\npregnant harms your baby”.\\nOther countries focus on different problems – like Sweden’s “alcohol may cause cerebral \\nhaemorrhage and cancer”, “half of people drowning have alcohol in the blood”, “children who \\nare served alcohol at home are more prone to binge drinking” and “alcohol may cause damage \\nto the nervous system and brain”. South Africa also has more speciﬁc warnings – such as, for \\nexample, “don’t drink and walk on the road, you may be killed”, “alcohol is a major cause of \\nviolence and crime”, and “alcohol increases your risk to personal injuries”. Two other examples \\nof more speciﬁc warnings include Panama’s “alcohol can lead to violent states and family \\ndisintegration” and Albania’s “drinking alcohol damages the young developing brain”.\\nThere are also examples that are similar to voluntary messages used by the alcohol industry, \\nsuch as Greece’s warning labels that read “enjoy responsibly”.\\n5.1.9 Addressing informal and illicit production\\nUnrecorded alcohol includes informally produced alcohol (i.e. homemade fermented/\\ndistilled beverages and small-scale production of traditional beverages) and illicit alcohol \\n(i.e. alcohol smuggled across borders or produced illegally to avoid taxes and tariffs) (Babor, \\n2010). Informal and illicit alcohol production poses unique health and policy challenges. \\nUnrecorded alcohol may contain higher ethanol content and potential contaminants (WHO, \\n2010), and the low cost can promote heavy drinking (Babor, 2010). In addition, it is difﬁcult \\nto gauge the level of consumption for unrecorded alcohol, thus undermining countries’ \\nefforts to tax and control legal alcohol production (WHO, 2010). To combat these harms, \\nthe Global strategy recommends bringing informally and illegally produced alcohol into the \\ntaxation system, implementing tax stamps, developing monitoring systems, and publishing \\nwarnings about the health risks of illicit and informal alcohol consumption (WHO, 2010).\\n'),\n",

WHO administered a survey in 2015 called the WHO Global \\nQuestionnaire on Progress in Alcohol Policy (WHO, 2011a), to discern progress in alcohol \\npolicies and interventions since the release of the Global strategy; gains (and losses) can \\nalso be detected by comparing answers from the Global Survey of Alcohol and Health in \\ndifferent years.

Using the same methods of calculating \\nadvertising restrictiveness as in Box 5.7, the Global Survey of Alcohol and Health \\nshowed there was a linear increase in the number of countries reporting more restrictive \\nadvertising policies for beer across all media types (Figure 5.22) as well as product \\nplacements on public television. However, substantial numbers of countries reported no \\naction regarding restriction of beer advertising before or after 2010 on the 2015 WHO \\nGlobal Questionnaire on Progress in Alcohol Policy. Consistent with the previous sections \\nof this report, few countries reported progress in developing regulations for new media \\nsince 2010. However, seven countries introduced a new total marketing ban since 2010, \\nwhich brings the number of countries in the world with such a ban to 21.\\n5.2.3 Trends in regulations of physical availability of alcohol\\nThere was no net gain in the policy area of availability, as advances were largely \\nundermined by losses. For example, the number of countries reporting restrictions on \\noutlet density (on-premise and off-premise) in the Global Survey on Alcohol and Health \\nsteadily decreased from 2008 to 2016 (Figure 5.23).

As shown in Chapter 1, the harmful use of alcohol has \\nan impact on a wide range of conditions which are among the main areas of action for \\nachieving the SDG health targets by 2030. Notably, a 10% relative reduction in harmful \\nuse of alcohol by 2025 in comparison with 2010 is one of nine targets in the NCD Global \\nMonitoring Framework (Chapter 2). \\nReviewing the progress achieved since 2010, as well as exploring the major challenges \\nand opportunities for reducing the harmful use of alcohol worldwide, is the focus of this \\nchapter.\\n6.1 PROGRESS IN ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION, ALCOHOL-\\nRELATED HARM AND POLICY RESPONSES\\nThe harmful use of alcohol causes 3 million deaths per year, is responsible for 5.1% of the \\nglobal burden of disease expressed in DALYs (Chapter 4) and continues to be one of the \\nleading risk factors for poor health globally. Currently available data presented in this report \\nindicate some progress in reducing the harmful use of alcohol in some WHO regions, but \\nthe reduction is still insufﬁcient to improve the situation dramatically. According to the \\nmost recent estimates in comparative risk assessment, alcohol was the seventh leading \\nrisk factor for deaths and disability in 2016 and the top risk factor among the world‘s \\npopulation aged 15–49 years (GBD 2016 Alcohol Collaborators, 2018).\\nFollowing the Political Declaration on NCDs adopted by the United Nations General \\nAssembly in 2011, WHO developed a global monitoring framework to enable global \\ntracking of progress in preventing and controlling major NCDs and their key risk factors \\n(Chapter 2). Nine global targets were set and 25 indicators were identiﬁed to monitor \\nprogress in achieving the targets. Three underlying indicators are monitoring the target of \\na 10% relative reduction in the harmful use of alcohol, as appropriate within the national \\ncontext, namely: total (recorded and unrecorded) alcohol per capita (aged 15+ years) \\nconsumption, age-standardized prevalence of heavy episodic drinking among adolescents \\nand adults, and alcohol-related morbidity and mortality among adolescents and adults. \\nTable 6.1 summarizes the relative change in these indicators within WHO regions and \\nthe world from 2010 to 2016. \\nAs shown in Chapter 3 of this report and Table 6.1, there is no progress in reducing the total \\nper capita alcohol consumption in the world in comparison with 2010. Alcohol per capita \\nconsumption was reduced signiﬁcantly in only one region – the WHO European Region \\nwhich surpassed the global voluntary target of 10% relative change in comparison with \\n'),\n",

Funding for implementation continues \\nto be scarce and insufﬁcient, especially in the WHO African, Americas and Eastern \\nMediterranean regions. Awareness-raising activities are common, but 30% of countries \\nproviding information to WHO indicate that these are funded by the alcohol industry, and \\nthere is substantial evidence that industry-funded initiatives are unlikely to be effective \\n(McCambrige, Mialon & Hawkins, 2018; Torjesen, 2011; Esser et al., 2016). Community \\naction projects regarding alcohol are widespread but they most frequently involve simply \\nproviding information, which is also unlikely to be effective in changing behaviour. \\nLaws to discourage or prevent drink–driving are a bright spot, with the majority of countries \\nhaving set BAC limits for drivers of 0.05% or lower. Policies offering responsible beverage \\nservice training and requiring labels to provide alcohol content have also spread widely, but \\njust eight countries require alcohol containers to disclose the number of standard drinks \\nthey contain. Most countries also report some kind of tracking system for informal or \\nillegal alcohol, and most countries with written alcohol policies include this in their policy \\ntexts. While population-level access to treatment for alcohol dependence remains limited \\nor unknown in much of the world, more than half of responding countries reported having \\nexpanded access to alcohol screening and brief intervention. However, this expanded \\naccess is mostly limited to higher-income countries. This is a consistent pattern when \\nit comes to other alcohol policies as well, and it is particularly evident with regard to the \\nmost effective policies, the “best buys”. The skewed prevalence of effective policies \\nraises issues of global health equity and underscores the need for greater resources \\nand priority to be placed on disseminating effective actions to low- and middle-income \\ncountries to reduce alcohol-related harm. \\nWhile almost all countries levy some kind of tax on alcohol, fewer than half report adjusting \\nthese taxes for inﬂation or using other price strategies such as minimum unit pricing or \\nbans on low-cost selling and volume discounts. For alcohol marketing, the least restrictive \\npolicies continue to be the most common, and countries in the WHO African Region and \\nthe Region of the Americas were the most likely to have no restrictions at all. Despite \\nan increase in countries adopting policies that limit alcohol advertising and marketing, \\nrestrictions on one of the fastest growing areas for this activity, the Internet and social \\nmedia, are rare.\\nThe situation is perhaps the worst in terms of the critically important “best buy” of alcohol \\navailability. With the exception of minimum age purchase laws which exist in most of \\nthe high- and middle-income countries, but not the lower-income countries, availability \\nrestrictions appear to be declining over time. Restrictions on days of sale and alcohol \\noutlet density exist in less than one-third of reporting countries, and barely half of the \\ncountries report limiting hours of sale. The number of licences to produce, distribute and \\nsell alcohol – a marker for increased rather than decreased availability – is increasing in \\nmuch of the world, particularly in lower-income countries.\\nConsiderable challenges for effective alcohol policy development and implementation \\nremain. These are associated, inter alia, with the complexity of the problem and \\nsometimes limited levels of political will and commitment of governments and other \\nstakeholders to supporting and implementing effective measures to reduce the harmful \\nuse of alcohol in a context of powerful commercial interests. \\n'),\n",

Among the \\npossible obstacles to effective alcohol policy-making are low levels of political commitment \\nfor effective coordination of multisectoral actions, the role of economic operators in alcohol \\nproduction and trade and associated commercial interests in lobbying against public health \\nobjectives, and strong drinking cultural traditions in many societies.\\n6.2.1 The challenges of a multisectoral approach, its coordination and \\nfocus on the role of health sector\\nHarms from alcohol, whether to the drinker or to family members and others around the \\ndrinker, include not only a wide variety of health disorders but also a wide range of social \\nproblems. The problems are dealt with by a variety of institutions for societal response, \\nincluding emergency services, the medical system, the police and criminal justice system, \\nwelfare services and religious institutions (Room & Hall, 2017). Each of these systems \\nare staffed primarily by speciﬁc professions and tend to be the main concern of different \\ngovernment departments. On an international level, the systems and their concerns fall \\nin the jurisdiction of different intergovernmental organizations. \\nResponsibility for dealing with the problems resulting from alcohol is thus diffused \\nbetween diverse systems, professions, government departments and intergovernmental \\nagencies – although alcohol problems are not a central concern of any of them (Room, \\n2018). The “division of labour” between professions, social institutions and government \\ndepartments – a central characteristic of modern societies (Durkheim, 1997) – thus makes \\nit difﬁcult to manage adequately and coherently an issue such as harmful use of alcohol \\nat national and international levels. \\nWithin the realm of health, there is a parallel difﬁculty. Alcohol has been recognized as a \\nmajor risk factor for noncommunicable diseases. However, alcohol is also an important \\nfactor in other health problems for the drinker, namely injuries and alcohol poisoning (which \\naccount for almost 40% of the alcohol-attributed DALYs globally) and infectious diseases \\n(Chapter 4). This overlooks the largely ignored physical and mental health problems of \\nothers around the drinker, for which data are unavailable for inclusion in these global \\ncounts. The range of physical and mental health problems to which alcohol makes a \\ncontribution makes it difﬁcult for public health bodies to take a comprehensive approach \\nat global, national and subnational levels. \\nThese challenges were evident in WHO Member States’ responses to the 2015 survey \\ninquiring about progress since the promulgation of the Global strategy in 2010 (Jernigan \\n& Trangenstein, 2017). Countries frequently cited low political will as a setback, as well \\nas difﬁculties in implementing meaningful change in countries without a clear policy for \\nalcohol regulation. Several countries also noted that the tendency to integrate alcohol \\ninto other policies (e.g. other drugs, mental health, NCDs) undermined the effectiveness \\nof the alcohol portion of the policy. Several WHO Member States described logistical \\nchallenges that hinder political commitment, such as the absence of a central agency, \\nregional variations in alcohol policy implementation and enforcement, fragmented health \\nsectors and lack of technical expertise. \\nAlcohol industry interference with policy-making and with its implementation was another \\ncommonly cited challenge.\\n'),\n",

Signiﬁcant inﬂuence \\nof alcohol industries on political decisions which affect them has been documented at \\nnational and subnational levels, (e.g. Room, 2004a; Hawkins, Holden & McCambridge, \\n2012; McCambrige, Mialon & Hawkins, 2018). In some countries with substantial alcohol \\nproduction and trade, this inﬂuence extends to the international level, both through national \\ndelegations in international organizations and negotiations, and through national, regional \\nand global alliances within and across industries (Ziegler, 2010; O’Brien, 2017). This \\ninterference was reported on several levels, including industry presence during legislative \\nmeetings as well as challenges to the legal basis of existing alcohol policies, which was \\nparticularly common for the “best buys” (Chapter 2). These legal challenges can then \\ncreate a feedback loop, undermining political commitment if legislators fear industry \\nlitigation. As noted earlier, there is no public health-oriented international agreement on \\nalcohol to counter the strong inﬂuence of the producers through the international trade \\ninstitutions and agreements. The situation varies at national and subnational levels, \\nthough general trends towards deregulation in recent decades have often resulted in the \\nweakening of alcohol controls – to the beneﬁt of economic interests but at the expense of \\npublic health and welfare. Substantial added resources are needed to provide leadership \\nat the international level to pursue the public health agendas for alcohol in the face of the \\nstrong presence of the global industry at the international policy level. \\nAlcohol producers may also inﬂuence public health and welfare perspectives in research \\n(McCambridge, Mialon & Hawkins, 2018). In the post-repeal era in the USA in the late \\n1930s, with few other resources available for research into alcohol problems, industry \\nsources began providing some resources for alcohol research – but on condition that it \\nconcentrated only on causes of “alcoholism”, conceptualized as a disease stemming \\nfrom the individual predisposition of the drinker (Roizen, 2004). More recently, a study of \\npotential health beneﬁts of light drinking (one drink per day) versus abstention, with alcohol \\nindustry multinationals and alliances as the main sources of the US$ 100 million funding, \\nwas discontinued after a government review group concluded that the interactions of \\nthe study’s investigators “and the alcohol industry ‘appear to have intentionally biased \\nthe framing of the scientiﬁc premise of the study’ in the direction of focusing on possible \\nbeneﬁts of alcohol” (Burton, 2018; ACD Working Group, 2018).

Times have \\nchanged, and these days cigarette smoking is a habit of the poor, at least in high-income \\ncountries (Hiscock et al., 2012). Alcoholic beverages are in a different situation; in many \\nsocieties, commercial alcohol is more frequently used by those of higher status than by \\npoorer people. Alcohol brands are often a symbol of luxury – among the few cross-cultural \\nsymbols of luxury foodstuffs offered, for instance, unstintingly for free to persons in the \\nﬁrst-class cabin on an airplane. The cultural position of alcohol as “our drug” in many \\nsocieties, and its use in elite circles, has posed challenges for public health efforts to \\nfocus appropriate political attention on effective measures for reducing the harmful use \\nof alcohol.\\nThis cultural acceptance of drinking, and often of drinking more than one or two drinks, \\nis also an element in the concept of “responsible drinking” which is actively promoted \\nby alcohol producers and their “social aspects” organizations. The concept and the \\nmessaging, pointing to individual responsibility as the mechanism of preventing harm, is \\nconsidered by public health experts to be strategically ambiguous and against the public \\nhealth interest (Smith, Atkin & Roznovski, 2006; Pantani et al., 2012; Smith, Cukier & \\nJernigan, 2014). Different forms of responsibility message – often combined with branding \\nor other product promotion – are ambiguous in terms of any concrete meaning, failing \\nfor instance to deﬁne when to stop drinking, or to suggest the option of not drinking, and \\nreinforcing the notion that decisions to drink responsibly (or not) lie with the consumer \\nand not with the policy, social and marketing environments (Maani-Pessari & Petticrew, \\n2017). The moralizing tone implicit in “responsible” thus turns attention from risks inherent \\nin the product, pointing instead to deﬁciencies in the drinker as the cause of any health \\nor social problems associated with drinking. In contrast, advice on drinking from public \\nhealth authorities has moved away from this position, instead emphasizing concepts such \\nas “low-risk drinking”, as in the ofﬁcial guidelines of Australia (NHMRC, 2009) and the \\nUnited Kingdom (UK Department of Health, 2016). \\nOther concepts linked with drinking culture relate to “safe drinking” and the “health \\nbeneﬁts of drinking”. The accumulated evidence indicates that alcohol consumption is \\nassociated with inherent health risks, although these risks vary in magnitude and the health \\nconsequences of drinking may be delayed in time (chapters 1 and 4). On the population \\nlevel, any level of alcohol consumption leads to losses of healthy life (GBD 2016 Alcohol \\nCollaborators, 2018; Burton and Sheron, 2018). \\n6.3 OPPORTUNITIES FOR REDUCING THE HARMFUL USE OF \\nALCOHOL \\nMany opportunities on the horizon may provide a path forward for WHO Member States \\naiming to reduce alcohol-related harms. Speciﬁc inclusion of a health goal in the SDGs, \\nwith a speciﬁc target oriented to the prevention of both narcotic drug abuse and harmful \\nuse of alcohol, and inclusion of harmful use of alcohol as one of the key risk factors in \\nthe NCD action plan, both help to keep alcohol and alcohol policies on the global agenda. \\nThe bright spots and case studies emphasized throughout this report demonstrate that \\ncountries can use policies to achieve reduction in alcohol-related harms. Conducting \\nand disseminating rigorous evaluations of these examples can serve as templates \\n'),\n",

The decline seems to be quite general across subdivisions of \\nthe population (e.g. Livingston, 2014). For a few countries for which measures are already \\navailable, the decline seems to be continuing into the next age group as the cohort grows \\nolder (Livingston, 2015). \\nThe wide distribution of the change suggests that factors which reach beyond speciﬁc \\npolicies or cultures must be in play, and collaborative research is currently under way to \\nidentify contributing factors (e.g. Pennay et al., 2018). Whatever the causes, the fact of \\nthe change offers considerable opportunity for public health policies and programming \\nto reduce harms from alcohol. Recent history in such areas as cigarette smoking and \\ndrink–driving suggests that it is the combination and mutual support of policy initiatives \\nwith shifts in popular sentiment that are most effective in improving public health. \\nWhile the decline in youth drinking is occurring in some of the heavier-drinking parts of \\nthe world, trends are in the opposite direction in many places, particularly in Asia (see \\nTable 3.6). A better understanding of factors behind the decline where it has occurred \\nwill point to avenues for broader positive change.\\nAs demonstrated in Chapter 3, there is a trend towards an increase in the proportion of \\nformer drinkers in populations. One of the factors contributing to this phenomenon is an \\nincreasing awareness of the health consequences of alcohol consumption, and particularly \\nits causal relationship with some types of cancer, liver and cardiovascular diseases, as \\nwell as infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV (Chapter 4). \\n6.3.2 Building on recognition of the role of alcohol control policies in \\nreducing health and gender inequalities\\nAs WHO has moved to analyse and counter adverse risks to health, alcohol has been \\nincreasingly recognized as a factor in health inequality (e.g. Blas & Sivisankara Kurup, \\n2010). As described in Chapter 1, within a given society, the health and social harm from \\na given level and pattern of drinking is greater for poorer people than for richer people, \\nand is greater in poorer societies than in richer ones. \\nOn the other hand, rates of abstaining from drinking are generally higher in low-income \\nthan in high-income societies and are higher among poorer people within a society than \\namong those who are richer. In addition, levels of drinking in a population often increase \\n'),\n",

In the past, economic \\ndevelopment has therefore often carried with it increases in alcohol consumption and \\nin harms from drinking. Policies and programmes to promote sustainable development \\nthus need to include sustained attention to policies and programmes that will discourage \\nheavy drinking and reduce harms from drinking.\\nEconomic development in societies where there is no strong religious norm against \\ndrinking is usually accompanied by strong efforts to “build the market” for alcoholic \\nbeverages, both from entrepreneurs within the society and from the transnational \\nﬁrms which now increasingly dominate the alcohol industry (Jernigan, 2009; Esser & \\nJernigan 2018). However, any economic gain from increased alcohol consumption will \\nbe outweighed by the costs and harms in terms of public health. Given the higher “harm \\nper litre” for poorer drinkers, increased alcohol consumption will also tend to increase \\nhealth and social inequalities – between genders as well as social classes. From the \\nperspective of public health and the public interest, sustainable development requires \\nstrengthening rather than loosening of the market controls on the availability, price and \\nmarketing of alcohol. In a growing economy, the public health interest is best served by \\ndiscouraging the initiation of drinking by those who currently abstain, and by discouraging \\nincreases in drinkers’ amount of drinking. Social policies should take into account, and \\nwork to counteract, the higher “harm per litre” for poorer drinkers and those around them. \\nAlcohol control measures oriented to reducing levels of drinking in the whole population, \\nsuch as higher taxes and restrictions on availability – among WHO’s “best buys” for \\nreducing harms from alcohol (WHO, 2017a) – tend to have a greater effect on poorer \\ndrinkers than on richer ones. In the conventional language of economists, such measures \\nare referred to as “regressive” because of this differential impact although, in the case of \\nalcohol, this disregards the higher rates of abstention from alcohol among poorer people \\n(Ashton, Casswell & Gilmore, 1989). From a public health perspective, a greater effect \\non poorer drinkers is a means of reducing health inequality. Measures such as WHO’s \\n“best buys” for alcohol policies thus contribute to a major goal of the 2030 Agenda for \\nSustainable Development. \\nIncreasing attention is being paid to the role of alcohol on gender inequality in many \\nsocieties. In every region of the world, men are more likely to drink, and much more \\nlikely to drink heavily, than women; as a result, on the global burden of disease (in DALYs) \\nattributable to men’s drinking is four times greater than the burden for women’s drinking \\n(Chapter 3).\\nThe imbalance between genders in relation to drinking plays out in multiple ways in terms \\nof the interests of women. Expenditures on drinking and behaviours accompanying it (e.g. \\ngambling) are decided on and made by an adult male in a family, but the amounts spent \\ncome from the budget which sustains the family as a whole. \\nThere is a growing recognition of the role of alcohol in violence against women, particularly \\nin the family. As noted in Chapter 1, a United Nations study of male perpetration of \\nintimate partner violence in six low- and middle-income countries in Asia and the Paciﬁc \\nfound that men in non-Muslim majority countries who acknowledged “alcohol misuse” \\nreported higher rates of intimate partner sexual violence (Fulu et al., 2013). WHO’s recent \\nGlobal Plan of Action on interpersonal violence, in particular against women and girls and \\nagainst children, notes “ease of access to alcohol” as a risk factor for the occurrence of \\nsuch violence, and “partner’s harmful use of alcohol” as a risk factor for intimate violence \\nagainst women (WHO, 2016). \\n'),\n",

According to the results \\nof this analysis, involving calculations of the cost estimates of implementation of “best \\nbuys” in 78 low- and middle-income countries, every additional US dollar invested in the \\nmost cost-effective interventions per person per year will return US$ 9.1 by 2030. This \\nreturn is higher than for a similar investment in tobacco control (US$ 7.4) or prevention \\nof physical inactivity (US$ 2.8) (WHO, 2018b). \\n6.4 THE WAY FORWARD: PRIORITY AREAS AT THE GLOBAL \\nLEVEL  \\nAlthough positive global changes are observed in 2016 in comparison with 2010 on several \\nimportant alcohol-related indicators (Tables 6.1 and 6.2), there is no reduction in total \\nper capita consumption worldwide, and alcohol use continues to be one of the leading \\nrisk factors for premature mortality and morbidity globally. While there is an estimated \\ndecrease at the global level of alcohol-attributable deaths and alcohol-attributable DALYs \\n(by 13.0% and 10.6% respectively), the global disease burden attributable to alcohol \\nconsumption is too high for complacency about the need for global actions to reduce \\nthe harmful use of alcohol. The lack of progress with the main alcohol-related SDG \\nindicator (total per capita alcohol consumption) requires concerted action to achieve at \\nleast stabilization of increasing trends in alcohol consumption in the South-East Asia and \\nWestern Paciﬁc regions, acceleration of the decreasing trend in the Region of Americas, \\ninitiation of a decrease in alcohol consumption in the African Region, and continued \\nsupport for positive changes in the European Region (Chapter 3). Currently available data \\nindicate that there is a decrease in the prevalence of drinkers in populations of all regions \\nexcept for the South-East Asia and Western Paciﬁc regions. In these regions special efforts \\nare needed to prevent initiation of drinking among children and adolescents, to support \\nadults who choose not to drink alcohol and to protect all from pressures to drink, in line \\nwith the guiding principles of the Global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol \\n(WHO, 2010). \\nAt the same time the data presented in Chapter 3 of this report draw attention to very \\nhigh mean levels of alcohol consumption among drinkers, amounting to 32.8 grams per \\nday among men and women, and more than 40 grams per day among men. As shown \\nin Chapters 1 and 4, these levels of alcohol consumption are associated with signiﬁcant \\nhealth risks. Hence, one of the priority areas for global action is to reduce the levels of \\nalcohol consumption among drinkers. \\nThere is a need to build on and accelerate the positive trends in prevalence of HED in \\npopulations (Table 6.1); this indicator should continue to be a focus of alcohol surveillance \\nand monitoring along with efforts aimed at reducing “binge drinking” in populations, \\nparticularly among young people.\\n'),\n",

This was later reinforced by the NCD Political \\nDeclaration and Action Plan, and more recently by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \\nDevelopment, with a speciﬁc SDG health target on substance abuse and an indicator on \\ntotal per capita alcohol consumption. The key interrelated components for global action \\noutlined in the Global strategy continue to be relevant measures to reduce the harmful \\nuse of alcohol. \\n6.4.1 Public health advocacy, partnership and dialogue\\nThe different social class distribution of drinking compared to tobacco, and the ubiquity of \\nalcohol for those in political and policy worlds, makes the task of public health advocacy \\nfor alcohol control and effective population-level measures to reduce harms from alcohol \\na more difﬁcult task than it is these days for tobacco. Public health advocacy is more \\nlikely to succeed if it is well backed up by evidence and based on emerging opportunities, \\nas described above, and if the arguments steer clear of moralization. The international \\ndiscourse on alcohol control should not be limited to NCDs, and should expand to other \\nareas of health and development, including a “harm to others” perspective, as outlined in \\nChapter 1. Public health agencies and institutions should take a lead in promoting a public \\nhealth agenda to reduce the harmful use of alcohol, building up broad partnerships and \\ncollaborative networks at all levels. Addressing the harmful use of alcohol requires “whole \\nof government” and “whole of society” approaches, with appropriate engagement of \\nnon-state actors, and particularly of public health-oriented NGOs, professional associations \\nand civil society groups. The lack of ﬁnancial support for civil society engagement stands \\nin stark contrast with tobacco ﬁeld and increased support is needed. At the international \\nlevel, the broad scope and magnitude of health and social problems caused by the harmful \\nuse of alcohol require coordinated and concerted actions of different parts of the United \\nNations system and regional intergovernmental organizations in the context of the 2030 \\nAgenda for Sustainable Development. Experience with efforts at national and subnational \\nlevels to deal more holistically with alcohol and its harms suggest some promising \\ndirections and, at the same time, help to identify approaches which have low probability \\nof success. Setting up a coordinating committee that is attended by relatively junior \\nrepresentatives and meets infrequently is a proven recipe for inaction. Experience with \\ncognate or overlapping areas where there has been some success, such as the prevention \\nof trafﬁc crashes or of cigarette smoking, suggests that a dedicated coordinating ofﬁce, \\nwith some means of ensuring the commitment of resources from the agencies involved, \\ncan work well. An alternative which also can work, where there is a strong political \\ncommitment to public health action and resources to pursue it, is a coordinating committee \\nof senior staff from the agencies involved. Some such arrangements are needed both \\nwithin public health and, more broadly, across the organizations or agencies working with \\nthe diverse social and health harms resulting from alcohol.\\nThe global dialogue with economic operators in alcohol production and trade should \\ncontinue with regard to how best the industry sectors can contribute to reducing the \\nharmful use of alcohol within their roles as developers, producers and distributors/sellers \\nof alcoholic beverage products. The main areas for the dialogue include self-regulation \\nof marketing within coregulatory frameworks, labelling and consumer information, \\nalcohol content in alcoholic beverages as well as provision of data useful for improving \\nestimates of alcohol consumption in populations. In this context it has to be underlined \\nthat regulatory controls on the market must be decided and enforced by governments, \\nwith public health interests as the primary goals. Such regulations and their enforcement \\nneed to be protected from industry interference. \\n'),\n",

The three effective \\nand cost-effective “best buys” of alcohol control – limiting physical availability, restricting \\nadvertising and marketing, and increasing price through taxation – are the best policy \\noptions and tools available to Member States for reducing the harmful use of alcohol. \\nThese core areas for effective action should be complemented by other recommended \\nmeasures (Chapters 2 and 5), and implementation of these measures at the country level \\nmay require strong technical assistance. This is particularly true when a health department \\nor agency has responsibility in areas which are not limited to health service interventions, \\nsuch as taxation, legislative measures or consideration of health protection from alcohol-\\nrelated harm in trade negotiations. \\nNew partnerships and appropriate engagement of all relevant stakeholders are needed to \\nsupport the implementation of practical and focused technical packages that can ensure \\nreturns on investments by reducing the harmful use of alcohol in populations. A new \\nWHO-led initiative to promote and support the implementation of “best buys” and other \\nrecommended alcohol-control measures at country level has been developed to invigorate \\naction in countries through coordinated actions of WHO partners within and outside the \\nUnited Nations system.  \\n6.4.3 Production and dissemination of knowledge\\nSince the previous edition of the WHO Global status report on alcohol and health (WHO, \\n2014), the data available on alcohol consumption – including its impact on health and \\ndevelopment, and the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of policy responses – have \\nimproved signiﬁcantly. Because of recent developments in national monitoring and \\nsurveillance systems, more and more countries are in a position to collect, collate and \\ndisseminate reliable information on alcohol use, its health and social consequences and \\npolicy developments, as evidenced by the contents of this report. The global monitoring \\nframework for control of NCDs and the SDGs of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \\nDevelopment provide new impetus to the development of national monitoring systems \\nand present new challenges for data collection and analysis at the global level.

There are no big donors with a strong interest in supporting work to reduce the \\nharmful use of alcohol worldwide or in high-burden countries. The successes in some \\njurisdictions in reducing the harmful use of alcohol were achieved, as a rule, with internal \\nresources using the most cost-effective interventions promoted by WHO (Chapter 5). \\nPositive changes in alcohol policies -- and subsequently in levels and patterns of alcohol \\nconsumption and associated mortality and morbidity -- in countries where drinking is \\nheavily embedded in cultural norms and traditions indicate that progressive alcohol policy \\ndevelopments are feasible in spite of all challenges; indeed, they can bring public health \\nbeneﬁts and returns on investments within relatively short periods of time (WHO, 2018b). \\nAlcohol consumption is the leading risk factor worldwide for people aged 15–49 years \\n(GBD 2016 Alcohol Collaborators, 2018) – the segment of the population which plays \\na signiﬁcant role in the economic and social development of every nation. Increasing \\nawareness of the impact of harmful use of alcohol on child development and maternal \\nhealth as well as on infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV (Chapter 1) may \\nchange the situation with regard to funding support for alcohol policy and programme \\ndevelopments, but this still has to happen. \\nThe lack of resources to ﬁnance prevention and treatment programmes and interventions \\nfor substance use disorders calls for innovative funding mechanisms to address related \\nSDG targets. Several innovative approaches that combine evidence-based knowledge with \\nmore “out of the box” ideas have been reported across countries and at the international \\nlevel. Recently the WHO Independent High-Level Commission on NCDs recommended \\nexploring the possibility of establishing a Global Solidarity Tobacco and Alcohol Contribution \\nas a voluntary innovative ﬁnancing mechanism to be used for the prevention and treatment \\nof NCDs (WHO, 2018c). There are existing examples of revenues from taxes on alcoholic \\nbeverages being used to fund health promotion initiatives, health coverage of vulnerable \\npopulations and/or prevention and treatment of alcohol and substance use disorders (Thow \\net al., 2010; Kaiser, Bredenkamp & Iglesias, 2016; McIntyre, 2015; Adulyanon et al., 2012; \\nOkulicz-Kozaryn et al., 2016), as well as, in some cases, supporting international work \\nin these areas. Other ideas for innovative funding mechanisms are directly linked to the \\nnotion that governments have the overall responsibility to implement preventive strategies \\nand interventions and to provide access to treatment for affected persons for conditions \\nthat directly stem from the consumption of substances or services which are legally traded \\nor operated, such as alcohol or gambling services. There are examples where earmarked \\nfunding for the prevention and treatment of substance use disorders and related conditions \\nis provided with funds generated from state-owned retail monopolies, from a proﬁt levy \\nacross alcohol beverage value chains, from taxing alcohol advertising, from imposing \\nearmarked ﬁnes for noncompliance with alcohol regulations, or from taxation and excise \\nduties on casinos and other forms of gambling (Llopis, 2017). \\n6.5 CONCLUSION\\nWith 3 million alcohol-attributable deaths in 2016 and well-documented adverse impacts \\non the health and well-being of individuals and populations, it is a public health imperative \\nto strengthen and sustain efforts to reduce the harmful use of alcohol worldwide. A \\nsigniﬁcant body of evidence has accumulated on the effectiveness of alcohol policy \\noptions, but often the most cost-effective policy measures and interventions are not \\nimplemented or enforced, and the alcohol-attributable disease burden continues to be \\nextraordinarily large. The wealth of data and analyses presented in this report can hopefully \\nprovide new grounds for advocacy, raising awareness, reinforcing political commitments \\nand promoting global action to reduce the harmful use of alcohol. \\n'),\n",

For estimates of unrecorded consumption, it was possible \\nto involve more countries than before in the nominal expert group Delphi survey (Probst et al., in press) and, \\nbecause of the inclusion of questions on unrecorded consumption in the alcohol module, it was also possible \\nto use responses from WHO’s STEPwise approach to surveillance (STEPS) surveys.1 For indicators that rely \\non national survey information – such as on abstainers, heavy episodic drinkers, or alcohol use disorders – a \\nlarger number of surveys than ever before were available to draw on for statistical modelling. In several areas \\nof the policy sections new questions were asked in the Global Survey on Alcohol and Health 2016.\\nThe most important data sources for alcohol-related information for all six chapters of this report is the WHO \\nGlobal Survey on Alcohol and Health, the last iteration of which was conducted in 2016 in collaboration with \\nall six WHO regional ofﬁces2 and the European Commission (in countries of the European Union). National \\ncounterparts or focal points in all WHO Member States in each region, who were ofﬁcially nominated by the \\nrespective ministries of health, were enabled to complete the survey data collection tool online. Where this was \\nnot feasible, a hard copy of the tool was forwarded directly to those who requested it. The questionnaire used \\nin 2016 was a modiﬁed version of the one used in 2012. The 44 questions were divided into three sections. \\nSection A addressed alcohol policy; Section B addressed alcohol consumption and Section C addressed \\nsurveillance system and health services responses on alcohol and drugs. The original English questionnaire \\nwas translated into French, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish. By the end of 2016, 173 WHO Member States \\nhad responded. This represents a response rate of 89.2% (2012, 91.2%) from WHO Member States, covering \\n98.3% (2012, 97.2%) of the world’s population. Whenever information was incomplete or in need of clariﬁcation, \\nthe questionnaire was returned to the focal point or national counterpart in the country concerned for revision. \\nAmendments to the survey responses were then resubmitted by email or electronically. The Global Survey \\non Alcohol and Health addresses the situation at the national level in a given country with additional questions \\nand space for comments on subnational speciﬁcities.3 If a country did not respond to a particular question, the \\ncountry was excluded from the analysis for that question. As described below, data from the United Nations \\nPopulation Division and the World Bank have been crucial for presenting alcohol-related information by gender, \\nWHO region and income level throughout this report.\\n1 See: http://www.who.int/ncds/surveillance/steps/instrument/STEPS_Instrument_V3.2.pdf (accessed 16 July 2018).\\n2 WHO Regional Ofﬁces for Africa (AFRO), the Americas (AMRO), Europe (EURO), the Eastern Mediterranean (EMRO), South-East Asia (SEARO), and the Western Paciﬁc (WPRO).\\n3 The data for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland refer mainly to England and Wales. India is a federated state with large differences between states. In the federated \\ncountries of Canada and the United States of America, most decisions on alcohol policy are taken at the subnational level, although efforts to report at the national level were made whenever \\npossible.\\n'),\n",

Ofﬁcial data on \\nrecorded alcohol per capita (15+ years) consumption supplied by the respective Member States were given \\npriority. If these data were not available, data from economic operators4 were used. When these data were \\nnot consistently available, data supplied by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) \\nstatistical database (FAOSTAT) were used.\\nFor recorded per capita consumption of alcohol, when data were not available for 2016 or 2017, data since \\n2012 were projected using a linear regression model. Data for these years were then averaged (2015, 2016 and \\n2017) and used as an estimate of recorded consumption for 2016. However, if the trend was not statistically \\nsigniﬁcant (i.e. the p-value was equal to or greater than 0.05), the recorded alcohol per capita consumption \\n(APC) value for 2015 was carried forward and used as the estimate for 2016 and 2017. In cases where data \\nfor 2016 existed and where no signiﬁcant trend in recorded APC was observed, the APC value for 2016 was \\ncarried forward and used as the estimate for 2017.\\nUnrecorded alcohol consumption was estimated as a percentage of total alcohol consumption. Country-level \\nproportions of unrecorded alcohol consumption were estimated using a regression analysis. Estimates of \\nunrecorded alcohol consumption were obtained from four sources: 1) Expert judgements from a WHO survey \\nof experts based on whether any changes in unrecorded consumption had occurred since 2010 (i.e. since the \\nWHO Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health 2014), the magnitude of these changes and documented \\nsupporting evidence; 2) a WHO and CAMH nominal expert group Delphi survey in 2013 assessing the proportion \\nof unrecorded alcohol consumption in 46 WHO Member States (response rate: 74%) where unrecorded alcohol \\nconsumption was relatively large (Rehm & Poznyak, 2015; Rehm et al., 2014) 3) a second WHO and Centre \\nfor Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) nominal expert group Delphi survey in 49 WHO Member States \\n(response rate: 86%; Probst et al., 2018; and 4) WHO’s STEPwise approach to surveillance (STEPS) surveys. \\nBased on these input data, the percentage of unrecorded to total consumption was estimated via a regression \\nmodel (Probst et al., 2018).\\nData for tourist estimations were obtained from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) which \\nbased its calculation on data from the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) (World Tourism Organization, \\n2016; www.healthdata.org). The litres of alcohol consumed by tourists in a country were based on the number \\nof tourists who visited a country, the average amount of time they spent in the country, and how much these \\npeople drink on average in their countries of origin (estimated on the basis of per capita consumption of \\nrecorded and unrecorded alcohol). Furthermore, tourist alcohol consumption also accounted for the inhabitants \\n4 GlobalData; International Wine and Spirits Research (IWSR); Organisation Internationale e la Vigne et du Vin (OIV); The Wine Institute.\\n'),\n",

These estimations assumed the \\nfollowing: 1) that people drink the same amounts of alcohol when they are tourists as they do in their home \\ncountries, and 2) that global tourist consumption is equal to 0 (and thus tourist consumption can be either net \\nnegative or positive) (Griswold, 2016).\\nTotal per capita alcohol consumption was then estimated by adding recorded and unrecorded alcohol \\nconsumption and adjusting for tourist alcohol consumption.  \\nThe main sources for data on alcohol drinking status and heavy episodic drinking (HED) were published survey \\nreports or multi-country, nationally representative surveys, including but not limited to the STEPwise approach \\nto surveillance and Gender, Alcohol and Culture: an international study.5 The main sources of data on young \\npersons (15-19 years of age) were the Global School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS)6 and the European \\nSchool Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD) report 2015.7 \\nData for 2010 and 2016 on drinking status (lifetime abstainers, former drinkers and past 12 months abstainers) \\nand the prevalence of HED were modelled using regression models. These regression models used data \\ncollected through a systematic search of all survey data on the previously mentioned measures of interest. The \\nindependent variables were: per capita consumption, population structure (sex, age), the size of the Muslim \\npopulation within the country, the region of the country, economic wealth (GDP-PPP) and the year from which \\nthe survey data were obtained. Model-speciﬁc covariates were added to account for variations in the outcomes, \\nsuch as reference periods for the assessment of the current drinking status (e.g. 30 days or 12 months). The \\nvalidity of the predicted estimates was assessed by comparing predicted estimates to actual estimates.\\nWhen interpreting data presented in Chapter 3, it is important to note that the data are only as reliable as the \\noriginal source data. This is illustrated by the fact that consumer surveys assessing people’s self-reported alcohol \\nconsumption usually show overall consumption ﬁgures which are much lower, quite often around 40-60% \\nof supply-based estimates (i.e. data on the production and trade of alcohol). This would indicate that people \\nunderestimate their own consumption and/or that these surveys do not reach the people with the highest \\nconsumption. Sales data, on the other hand, do not allow for the disaggregation of recorded alcohol consumption \\nby sex and age. To this end, other data sources such as survey data for measures of abstention are needed.\\nFor this reason, as input for the burden calculations, survey estimates were triangulated with APC to adjust \\nfor underestimation by surveys that often account for less than half of the actual amount of alcohol consumed \\n(for reasoning, see Rehm, Klotsche & Patra, 2007; for procedures used, see Rehm et al., 2010; Kehoe et al., \\n2012). A value of 80% of APC was used to be conservative, to account for spillage/waste and to account for \\npossible underestimation of epidemiological studies on risk relations (Stockwell et al., in press).\\nProjections for total alcohol consumption data for 2020 and 2025 were derived from ARIMA or linear regression \\nanalyses. For each country, ARIMA models on recorded per capita consumption were evaluated using GDP-PPP \\nand Muslim population as covariates. For countries where ARIMA models showed an insufﬁcient ﬁt, simple \\nlinear models using year as a covariate were preferred in order to continue the trend of the last available years. \\nForecasts of recorded alcohol consumption were obtained from the chosen models. Total APC was calculated \\nfollowing the procedure described above to estimate unrecorded and tourist consumption, carrying forward \\nthe last available proportion of total consumption for these indicators.\\n \\n5 See: http://www.genacis.org/, (accessed 16 July 2018).\\n6 http://www.who.int/ncds/surveillance/gshs/GSHS_Core_Modules_2013_English.pdf, (accessed 16 July 2018).\\n7 See: www.espad.org/sites/espad.org/ﬁles/ESPAD_report_2015.pdf, (accessed 16 July 2018).\\n'),\n",

All efforts were made to check the methodological quality of the surveys conducted in \\nvarious parts of the world, but it was not feasible to verify systematically or conﬁrm whether (a) all surveys \\nwere reviewed, as appropriate, by relevant ethics review committees, (b) all survey results were published in \\npeer-reviewed journals or (c) how all surveys were funded, including the sources of funding.\\nWith respect to the estimates of prevalence of alcohol consumption and HED in the Americas, the estimates \\nwere produced by mathematic modelling based on the survey data available from the region, and the model \\ninput data included results of studies conducted by FLACSO (Facultad Latino Americana de Ciencias Sociales) \\nin Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru and Venezuela. In this \\nregard, WHO has learned that these studies were conducted using funds received from the alcohol industry \\nand that the studies conducted in Costa Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua, Peru and Venezuela were not reviewed \\nby relevant ethics review committees. This in turn has led to concerns being expressed about the validity and \\ninterpretation of data generated in the FLACSO studies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it should be noted that \\nWHO estimates of prevalence of alcohol consumption and HED in the Americas are based on the results of \\nmathematical modelling with input data from multiple sources, including studies in the above-listed countries \\nthat have not been conducted by FLACSO.\\nIV.1.3 CHAPTER 4 – HEALTH CONSEQUENCES\\nThe prevalence of people with alcohol use disorders (AUDs) (harmful use of alcohol and alcohol dependence) \\nwas obtained from population surveys. When survey data were not available the AUD estimates were carried \\nforward from the Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health 2014.\\nThe health consequences due to alcohol consumption were estimated on the basis of 1) the prevalence of \\nAUDs by age, sex and country, and 2) the deaths, years of life lost (YLL), years lived with disability (YLD), and \\ndisability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to alcohol consumption.\\nMortality and morbidity data\\nDeaths, YLL, YLD and DALYs were obtained from the WHO Global Health Observatory by cause, age, sex and \\nyear (2010 and 2016). To match age-standardization data, deaths, YLL, YLD and DALYs were aggregated into \\nthe following age groups: 0 to 4, 5 to 9, 10 to 14, 15 to 19, 20 to 24, 25 to 29, 30 to 34, 35 to 39, 40 to 44, 45 \\nto 49, 50 to 54, 55 to 59, 60 to 64, 65 to 69, 70 to 74, 75 to 79, 80 to 84, and 85 years of age and older. The \\ncauses of death which were extracted are presented in Table IV.8.\\nUsing Formula IV.1 (WHO, 2018a), estimates of motor vehicle deaths due to alcohol consumption were stratiﬁed \\ninto those involving the driver and those involving others, based on the fractions of motor vehicle deaths \\nthat involved drivers and involved people other than the driver as obtained from the WHO road trafﬁc deaths \\ndatabase. This method estimates the number of deaths (D) among drivers (d) using the fraction (F) of injury \\nevents in a country that occurred among drivers by sex (indexed by i) and age (indexed by p including people \\n15 years of age and older). The method of estimating the number of motor vehicle accident (MVA) injuries \\ninvolving drivers assumed that all motor vehicle accident injuries to drivers occurred among people aged 15 \\nyears or older (i.e. all MVA injuries occurring among people 0-14 years of age involved people other than the \\ndriver). For countries where data were not available, the fractions of injuries among drivers and among people \\nother than the driver were imputed as the regional averages. To estimate the number of YLL, YLD, and DALYs \\namong drivers, the fraction of deaths among drivers compared to all MVA deaths (by age and sex) were used. \\nAll other MVA deaths, YLLs YLDs and DALYs affected people other than the driver.\\n'),\n",

of alcoholic cardiomyopathy mortality and morbidity\\nDeaths, YLL, YLD and DALYs due to alcoholic cardiomyopathy (ICD-10 code: I42.6) are not estimated speciﬁcally \\neither by WHO or by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) annual statistics, and are contained \\nin the larger category of cardiomyopathy, myocarditis and endocarditis mortality and morbidity (ICD-10 codes: \\nI30–I33, I38, I40, I42). However, alcoholic cardiomyopathy deaths are reported by some countries through the \\nWHO Mortality database. Therefore, the number of deaths from alcoholic cardiomyopathy was estimated using \\nthe data from WHO Mortality database for countries which reported ICD-I42.6 deaths. As death data are not \\navailable for every year, an average was used of the number of alcoholic cardiomyopathy deaths from 2006 \\nto 2014 for 2010 and from 2012 to 2017 for 2016 (where data were available). Thus, the number of alcoholic \\ncardiomyopathy deaths was estimated using the methodology of Manthey and colleagues (Manthey et al., \\n2017; Manthey et al., 2018). In cases where alcoholic cardiomyopathy deaths were not reported, the number \\nof alcoholic cardiomyopathy deaths was imputed using the methodology of Manthey and colleagues (Manthey \\net al., 2017; Manthey et al., 2018). These imputations were based on a negative binomial regression model. For \\nmen, the regression model was based on per capita consumption of alcohol and the number of cardiomyopathy, \\nmyocarditis and endocarditis deaths. For women, the regression model was based on per capita consumption \\nof alcohol, the prevalence of AUDs and the population size.\\nMortality and morbidity attributable to alcohol consumption\\nThe categories of mortality and morbidity included in the health burden estimates were based on the causal \\nassociation of alcohol consumption with the occurrence of the diseases and injuries. The inclusion of diseases \\nand the causal association of alcohol was assessed by the WHO Technical Advisory Group on Alcohol and \\nDrug Epidemiology (see Table IV.8).\\nThe number of deaths, YLL, YLD and DALYs attributable to alcohol consumption were estimated using a \\nLevin-based population-attributable fraction (PAF) methodology (Levin, 1953). The association of alcohol and \\nmortality is complex: alcohol has a protective effect (when compared to lifetime abstainers) on ischaemic heart \\ndisease, ischaemic stroke and diabetes for drinkers who consume low volumes of alcohol and do not binge \\ndrink (Roerecke & Rehm, 2010; Guiraud et al., 2010; Leong et al., 2014; Roerecke & Rehm, 2014; Knott, Bell & \\nBritton, 2015). However, the overall protective effect of alcohol consumption depends on the risks of diseases \\nand injuries associated or not associated with alcohol (i.e. competing risks) (Shield et al., 2017). Therefore, in \\naccordance with the methods of previous comparative risk assessment studies, the mortality and morbidity \\nattributable to alcohol consumption were estimated using a counterfactual scenario (i.e. theoretical minimum \\nrisk) of lifetime abstention (i.e. no historical consumption of alcohol) (Ezzati et al., 2004). For diseases and injuries \\nwhere alcohol is a necessary cause (i.e. AUDs (ICD-10 codes: F10, G72.1, Q86.0 and X45)), the attributable \\nfraction was assumed to be 1. For diseases and injuries where alcohol is a potential component cause (i.e. \\nwhere alcohol raises the risk of disease or injury occurrence but the disease or injury may still occur in the \\nabsence of alcohol) a PAF is used to estimate the fraction of deaths, YLL, YLD and DALYs attributable to alcohol.\\nEstimation of alcohol-attributable fractions\\nWith respect to noncommunicable diseases (other than cancer), no latency period was used in the estimation \\nof the attributable fractions. For cancer mortality and morbidity attributable to alcohol consumption, a latency \\n'),\n",

Population age-standardized rates were based on the WHO standard \\npopulation (Ahmad et al., 2001).\\nRelative risks\\nWhere available, the selection of RRs was based on systematic reviews of meta-analyses (see Table IV.8). For \\nBelarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Russia and Ukraine, RRs from the Russian cohort study by Zaridze \\nand colleagues were used to model mortality and morbidity from tuberculosis, lower respiratory infections, \\nischaemic heart disease, ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, liver cirrhosis, pancreatitis, road injuries, other \\nunintentional injuries, self-harm and interpersonal violence attributable to alcohol consumption (Zaridze et al., \\n2009; Shield & Rehm, 2015).\\nModelling alcohol consumption for the estimation of alcohol attributable mortality and morbidity\\nAlcohol consumption was modelled as 1) drinking status (current drinkers, former drinkers, lifetime abstainers), \\n2) average daily volume of alcohol consumption among current drinkers, modelled on the basis of per capita \\nconsumption, the prevalence of current drinkers and the amount of alcohol consumed among current drinkers \\nby age and sex, and 3) binge drinkers, deﬁned as drinking 60 grams or more of pure alcohol on one occasion, \\nmodelled on the basis of the prevalence of current drinkers and the prevalence of binge drinkers among \\ncurrent drinkers. (For the estimation process for current drinkers and binge drinkers, see the method outlined \\nin Chapter 3.) Data on alcohol consumption (drinking status and amount consumed by current drinkers) and \\nbinge drinking were available by age group (15-19 years, 20-24 years, 25-34 years, 35-49 years, 50-64 years, \\nand 65 years of age and older) and sex.\\nThe amount of alcohol consumed by current drinkers was adjusted using a correction factor of 0.8. This \\ncorrection factor was used to account for 1) alcohol that was not consumed, and 2) the underreporting of \\nalcohol consumption in medical observation studies from which the RR estimates used in this study were \\nobtained (Gmel & Rehm, 2004). A study by Stockwell and colleagues found that cohort studies of the \\nrelationship between alcohol consumption and all-cause mortality had a coverage rate (when compared to \\nper capita consumption) of 61.71% (ranging from 29.19% for Russia to 96.53% for Japan) (Stockwell et al., \\nin press). The adjustment of survey data can be justiﬁed by the observation that the underreporting of alcohol \\nconsumption in medical epidemiology studies (King, 1994; Rehm, 1998; Feunekes et al., 1999) is much less \\nthan in population surveys; population-level surveys underestimate alcohol consumption because, on average, \\nsuch surveys ask many fewer questions that are used to measure alcohol consumption compared to the \\nnumber of such questions asked in medical epidemiology studies (King, 1994; Rehm, 1998; Feunekes et al., \\n1999). Furthermore, the undercoverage of population surveys is also affected by recruitment biases (Shield & \\nRehm, 2012); however, the adjustment of survey data assumes that the undercoverage of alcohol consumption \\nis constant by age and sex.\\nAverage daily alcohol consumption among current drinkers was modelled using a Gamma distribution in \\naccordance with the methodology outlined by Rehm and colleagues (Rehm et al., 2010) and Kehoe and \\ncolleagues (Kehoe et al., 2012). This methodology was developed using data from over 60 individual surveys \\nconducted in both developing and developed countries. Firstly, this method assumes that the average daily \\nalcohol consumed among current drinkers can be accurately modelled using a Gamma distribution, which was \\nthe case in the surveys examined by both Rehm and Kehoe and their respective colleagues. Secondly, this \\nmethod assumes that the standard deviation of the Gamma distribution of alcohol consumption can be predicted \\n'),\n",

These intervals were \\nbased on the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the distribution of PAF estimates constructed using 1000 samples \\nof the lowest-level parameters of alcohol consumption and RRs from their respective probability distributions \\n(Gmel et al., 2011). Uncertainty from population ﬁgures and mortality and morbidity data was not incorporated \\ninto the 95% UIs. When modelled, alcoholic cardiomyopathy deaths also took into consideration uncertainty \\nin the regression model and the regression inputs.\\nIV.1.4 CHAPTER 5 – ALCOHOL POLICY AND INTERVENTIONS\\nChapter 5 presents 23 alcohol policy indicators collected using the 2016 Global Survey on Alcohol and Health \\nquestionnaire. The data represent the national status of alcohol policies as of December 2016. For the purpose \\nof the 2016 Global Survey on Alcohol and Health, “alcohol policy” was referred to as an organized set of values, \\nprinciples and objectives for reducing the burden attributable to alcohol consumption by the population. Various \\nother policies also impinge on alcohol-related problems, increasing or decreasing them, but these policies are \\nnot adopted or implemented with the minimization of alcohol problems as their primary aim. Such policies are \\nnormally neither described as alcohol policies nor included within an overall alcohol policy description. When \\ninterpreting the data in Chapter 5, it is crucial to note that the number and subset of WHO Member States that \\nresponded to the Global Survey on Alcohol and Health in 2016 differed from those of 2012 (i.e. 173 versus \\n177). It should also be noted that for those countries where alcohol use is universally banned (see Table IV.10), \\nonly responses to speciﬁc questions were included in the analyses (e.g. responses on legislation regarding \\nblood alcohol concentration, or BAC).\\nIV.1.5 COUNTRY PROFILES\\nIndividual country proﬁles were prepared to give an overview of the current situation regarding alcohol and \\nhealth in WHO Member States. This was achieved on the basis of 57 key indicators chosen by a group of \\nexperts; the indicators reﬂect the 10 target areas of policy measures and interventions at the national level as \\nrecommended in the Global Strategy to Reduce the Harmful Use of Alcohol (WHO, 2010) and for which the \\nfullest data were collected. Because of space limitations, not all the information collected in the questionnaire is \\npresented in this report. However, all data collected are available on the Global Information System on Alcohol \\nand Health (GISAH) website.\\nAlthough great efforts have been made to validate data received from countries, caution should be exercised \\nin their interpretation. While there has been basic validation of inconsistencies by the focal points and national \\ncounterparts within the framework of the WHO Global Survey on Alcohol and Health, the data on alcohol \\npolicy have not been checked against the actual policy legislation in the countries concerned. However, for 19 \\ncountries in the WHO Region of the Americas the actual legislation documents were reviewed. In late 2017, \\npreviews of the country proﬁles were sent to the respective governments and changes were made as needed.\\nData sources and methods relating to the indicators presented in the country proﬁles that do not appear \\nelsewhere can be found on the GISAH website as well as sources of data used to estimate abstainers and \\nHED and sources of data used to estimate AUDs and alcohol dependence.\\n'),\n",

However, health outcomes such as deaths or \\nhospitalizations are markedly inﬂuenced by age; thus, simple \\n(or in epidemiological terms crude) rates are inﬂuenced by the \\nage distribution in countries. Developing countries have age \\ndistributions different from those of high-income countries – for \\ninstance, developing countries have more people in younger age \\ncategories.\\nTo allow for comparability across countries, rates are statistically \\nadjusted to one common population structure (the standardized \\npopulation). In other words, standardized rates simulate a \\nsituation in which all countries would have the same age \\ndistribution in their population. Data are standardized using the \\nWHO standard population data to reﬂect a number per 100 000 \\npopulation (WHO, 2014c).\\nAlcohol-attributable fractions \\nfor liver cirrhosis, road trafﬁc \\ninjuries and cancer, and for \\ndeaths from all causes, 2016\\nThe alcohol-attributable fraction (AAF) denotes the proportion of \\na health outcome, which is caused by alcohol (i.e., that proportion \\nwhich would disappear if alcohol consumption was removed). \\nAlcohol consumption has a causal impact on more than 200 \\nhealth conditions (diseases and injuries). \\nPopulation-attributable fractions are calculated based on the \\nlevel of exposure to alcohol and the risk relations between \\nconsumption and different disease or injury categories. For each \\ndisease the exact proportion is different and will depend on the \\nlevel and patterns of alcohol consumption, and on the relative \\nrisks. Data are presented as a percentage.\\nAlcohol-attributable number \\nof deaths for liver cirrhosis, \\nroad trafﬁc injuries and cancer, \\n2016\\nThe absolute number of deaths that can be attributed to alcohol \\nfor each of the three causes of death.\\nAlcohol-related deaths are calculated as the total number of \\ndeaths (for each age-sex-country-disease unit) multiplied by the \\nAAF (see above) for the same age-sex-country-disease unit.\\nYears of life lost (YLL) score \\n2016\\nA score from 1 to 5 was calculated, based on the percentage of \\nYLL that can be attributed to alcohol where 1 was the lowest \\npercentage of years lost and 5 was the highest percentage.\\nThe YLL score is based on alcohol-attributable YLLs as a \\npercentage of all YLLs, approximate quintiles. This takes account \\nof the size of the country, as well as the overall life expectancy, \\nwhich is determined mostly by wealth. \\nAlcohol-attributable disability-\\nadjusted life years (DALYs)\\nThe DALY is a measure of overall disease burden. Alcohol-\\nattributable DALYs may be interpreted as the number of years \\nlost due to ill-health, disability or early death from the use of \\nalcohol. Alcohol attributable DALYs are DALYs that would not have \\noccurred if alcohol were not consumed in the population.\\nAlcohol-attributable DALYs are calculated as the sum of alcohol-\\nattributable YLL and YLD (years lost due to  disability). Alcohol-\\nattributable YLL and YLD are calculated as the total number of \\nYLL/YLD for each age-sex-country-disease unit multiplied by the \\nAAF for each age-sex-coountry-disease unit. AAFs for  YLL and \\nYLD are calculated separately, as alcohol may have a different \\nimpact on fatal versus nonfatal  outcomes.\\nPrevalence of alcohol-use \\ndisorders and alcohol \\ndependence\\nData on the prevalence of people with alcohol use disorders \\n(AUDs) including harmful use and alcohol dependence. \\nWhere available, the original survey data on AUDs were used. \\nWhen survey data were not available, the prevalence of AUDs from \\nthe Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health 2014 was used.\\nTable IV.7 Brief description of the methodology and data sources for indicators related to health consequences\\n'),\n",

      "FOREWORD\n",
      "Control alcohol, promote health, protect future generations\n",
      "Alcohol use is part of many cultural, religious and social practices, and provides perceived \n",
      "pleasure to many users. This new report shows the other side of alcohol:  the lives its \n",
      "harmful use claims, the diseases it triggers, the violence and injuries it causes, and the \n",
      "pain and suffering endured as a result. \n",
      "This report presents a comprehensive picture of how harmful alcohol use impacts \n",
      "population health, and identiﬁes the best ways to protect and promote the health and \n",
      "well-being of people. \n",
      "It also shows the levels and patterns of alcohol consumption worldwide, the health and \n",
      "social consequences of harmful alcohol use, and how countries are working to reduce \n",
      "this burden.\n",
      "While less than half of the world’s adults have consumed alcohol in the last 12 months, the \n",
      "global burden of disease caused by its harmful use is enormous. Disturbingly, it exceeds \n",
      "those caused by many other risk factors and diseases high on the global health agenda. \n",
      "Over 200 health conditions are linked to harmful alcohol use, ranging from liver diseases, \n",
      "road injuries and violence, to cancers, cardiovascular diseases, suicides, tuberculosis and \n",
      "HIV/AIDS. \n",
      "Although the highest levels of alcohol consumption are in Europe, Africa bears the heaviest \n",
      "burden of disease and injury attributed to alcohol. \n",
      "The report ﬁnds that while inaction on alcohol control is widespread, there is also hope. For \n",
      "example, political commitment at the highest level to implement effective interventions \n",
      "has contributed substantially to the sharp reduction of alcohol use and related harm in \n",
      "eastern Europe. \n",
      "The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to provide a more equitable and \n",
      "sustainable future for all people by 2030, ensuring that no one is left behind. While the \n",
      "agenda’s goals have health targets on substance abuse and addressing noncommunicable \n",
      "diseases, reducing alcohol-related harm also increases the chances of reaching other \n",
      "targets.  \n",
      "Maintaining the momentum towards the SDGs is only possible if countries demonstrate \n",
      "the political will and capacity to meet the different targets. Countries have committed to \n",
      "bring about change as part of the Global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol and \n",
      "the WHO Global action plan for the prevention and control of NCDs 2013–2020.  \n",
      "Now the task we share is to help countries put in place policies that make a real and \n",
      "measurable difference in people’s lives. \n",
      "We have no time to waste; it is time to deliver on alcohol control.\n",

Code is available at https://github.com/RManLuo/\\ngraph-constrained-reasoning.\\n1\\nINTRODUCTION\\nLarge language models (LLMs) have shown impressive reasoning abilities in handling complex\\ntasks (Qiao et al., 2023; Huang & Chang, 2023), marking a significant leap that bridges the gap\\nbetween human and machine intelligence. However, LLMs still struggle with conducting faithful\\nreasoning due to issues of lack of knowledge and hallucination (Huang et al., 2024; Wang et al.,\\n2023). These issues result in factual errors and flawed reasoning processes (Nguyen et al., 2024),\\nwhich greatly undermine the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications.\\nTo address these issues, many studies utilize knowledge graphs (KGs), which encapsulate extensive\\nfactual information in a structured format, to improve the reasoning abilities of LLMs (Pan et al.,\\n2024; Luo et al., 2024). Nevertheless, because of the unstructured nature of LLMs, directly applying\\nthem to reason on KGs is challenging.\\nExisting KG-enhanced LLM reasoning methods can be roughly categorized into two groups:\\nretrieval-based and agent-based paradigms, as shown in Figure 2 (a) and (b). Retrieval-based meth-\\nods (Li et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2024b; Dehghan et al., 2024) retrieve relevant facts from KGs\\nwith an external retriever and then feed them into the inputs of LLMs for reasoning. Agent-based\\nmethods (Sun et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2024) treat LLMs as agents that iteratively\\ninteract with KGs to find reasoning paths and answers.\\n∗Equal Contribution.\\n†Corresponding author.\\n1\\narXiv:2410.13080v1  [cs.CL]  16 Oct 2024\\n67.0%\\n18.0%\\n15.0%\\nFaithful Reasoning Path\\nInvalid - Format Error\\nInvalid - Relation Error\\nFigure\\n1:\\nAnalysis\\nof reasoning errors in\\nRoG (Luo et al., 2024).\\nDespite their success, retrieval-based methods require additional accurate\\nretrievers, which may not generalize well to unseen questions or account\\nfor the graph structure (Mavromatis & Karypis, 2024). Conversely, agent-\\nbased methods necessitate multiple rounds of interaction between agents\\nand KGs, leading to high computational costs and latency (Dehghan et al.,\\n2024). Furthermore, existing works still suffer from serious hallucination\\nissues (Agrawal et al., 2024). Sui et al. (2024) indicates that RoG (Luo\\net al., 2024), a leading KG-enhanced reasoning method, still experiences\\n33% hallucination errors during reasoning on KGs, as shown in Figure 1.\\nTo this end, we introduce graph-constrained reasoning (GCR), a novel KG-\\nguided reasoning paradigm that connects unstructured reasoning in LLMs\\nwith structured knowledge in KGs, seeking to eliminate hallucinations dur-\\ning reasoning on KGs and ensure faithful reasoning. Inspired by the con-\\ncept that LLMs reason through decoding (Wei et al., 2022), we incorporate\\nthe KG structure into the LLM decoding process. This enables LLMs to directly reason on graphs\\nby generating reliable reasoning paths grounded in KGs that lead to correct answers.\\nIn GCR, we first convert KG into a structured index, KG-Trie, to facilitate efficient reasoning on KG\\nusing LLM. Trie is also known as the prefix tree (Wikipedia contributors, 2024) that compresses a\\nset of strings, which can be used to restrict LLM output tokens to those starting with valid prefixes\\n(De Cao et al., 2022; Xie et al., 2022). KG-Trie encodes the reasoning paths in KGs as formatted\\nstrings to constrain the decoding process of LLMs. Then, we propose graph-constrained decoding\\nthat employs a lightweight KG-specialized LLM to generate multiple KG-grounded reasoning paths\\nand hypothesis answers. With the constraints from KG-Trie, we ensure faithful reasoning while\\nleveraging the strong reasoning capabilities of LLMs to efficiently explore paths on KGs in constant\\ntime. Finally, we input multiple generated reasoning paths and hypothesis answers into a powerful\\ngeneral LLM to utilize its inductive reasoning ability to produce final answers. In this way, GCR\\ncombines the graph reasoning strength of KG-specialized LLMs and the inductive reasoning advan-\\ntage in general LLMs to achieve faithful and accurate reasoning on KGs. The main contributions of\\nthis work are as follows:\\n• We propose a novel framework called graph-constrained reasoning (GCR) that bridges the\\ngap between structured knowledge in KGs and unstructured reasoning in LLMs, allowing\\nfor efficient reasoning on KGs via LLM decoding.\\n• We combine the complementary strengths of a lightweight KG-specialized LLM with a\\npowerful general LLM to enhance reasoning performance by leveraging their respective\\ngraph-based reasoning and inductive reasoning capabilities.\\n• We conduct extensive experiments on several KGQA reasoning benchmarks, demonstrat-\\ning that GCR not only achieves state-of-the-art performance with zero hallucination, but\\nalso shows zero-shot generalizability for reasoning on unseen KGs without additional train-\\ning.\\n2\\nRELATED WORK\\nLLM reasoning. Many studies have been proposed to analyze and improve the reasoning ability\\nof LLMs (Wei et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2024; Yao et al., 2024). To elicit the reasoning ability\\nof LLMs, Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2022) prompts the model to generate a\\nchain of reasoning steps in response to a question. Wang et al. (2024) propose a self-consistency\\nmechanism that generates multiple reasoning paths and selects the most consistent answer across\\nthem. The tree-of-thought (Yao et al., 2024) structures reasoning as a branching process, exploring\\nmultiple steps in a tree-like structure to find optimal solutions. Other studies focus on fine-tuning\\nLLMs on various reasoning tasks to improve reasoning abilities (Yu et al., 2022; Hoffman et al.,\\n2024). For instance, OpenAI (2024c) adopts reinforcement learning to train their most advanced\\nLLMs called “OpenAI o1” to perform complex reasoning, which produces a long internal chain of\\nthought before final answers.\\nKG-enhanced LLM reasoning. To mitigate the knowledge gap and hallucination issues in LLM\\nreasoning, research incorporates KGs to enhance LLM reasoning (Pan et al., 2024).

To capture graph structure, GNN-\\nRAG (Mavromatis & Karypis, 2024) adopts a lightweight graph neural network to effectively re-\\ntrieve from KGs. Instead of retrieving, StructGPT (Jiang et al., 2023) and ToG (Sun et al., 2024)\\ntreat LLMs as agents to interact with KGs to find reasoning paths leading to the correct answers.\\n3\\nPRELIMINARY\\nKnowledge Graphs (KGs) represent a wealth of factual knowledge as a collection of triples: G =\\n{(e, r, e′) ∈E × R × E}, where E and R denote the set of entities and relations, respectively.\\nReasoning Paths are sequences of consecutive triples in KGs: wz = e0\\nr1\\n−→e1\\nr2\\n−→. . .\\nrl\\n−→el,\\nwhere ∀(ei−1, ri, ei) ∈G. The paths reveal the connections between knowledge that potentially\\nfacilitate reasoning. For example, the reasoning path: wz = Alice\\nmarry to\\n−−−−−−→Bob\\nfather of\\n−−−−−−→\\nCharlie indicates that “Alice” is married to “Bob” and “Bob” is the father of “Charlie”. Therefore,\\n“Alice” could be reasoned to be the mother of “Charlie”.\\nKnowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) is a representative reasoning task with the as-\\nsistance of KGs. Given a natural language question q and a KG G, the task aims to design a function\\nf to reason answers a ∈A based on knowledge from G, i.e., a = f(q, G).\\n3\\n4\\nAPPROACH\\n4.1\\nFROM CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT REASONING TO GRAPH-CONSTRAINED REASONING\\nChain-of-Thought Reasoning (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022) has been widely adopted to enhance the\\nreasoning ability of LLMs by autoregressively generating a series of reasoning steps leading to the\\nanswer. Specifically, given a question q, CoT models the joint probability of the answer a and\\nreasoning steps z as\\nP(a|q) =\\nX\\nz\\nPθ(a|z, q)Pθ(z|q) =\\nX\\nz\\nPθ(a|q, z)\\n|z|\\nY\\ni=1\\nPθ(zi|q, z1:i−1),\\n(1)\\nwhere q denotes the input question, a denotes the final answer, θ denotes the parameters of LLMs,\\nand zi denotes the i-th step of the reasoning process z. To further enhance the reasoning ability,\\nmany previous works focus on improving the reasoning process Pθ(z|q) by exploring and aggregat-\\ning multiple reasoning processes (Wang et al., 2024; Yao et al., 2024).\\nDespite the effectiveness, a major issue remains the faithfulness of the reasoning process generated\\nby LLMs (Huang et al., 2024). The reasoning is represented as a sequence of tokens decoded\\nstep-by-step, which can accumulate errors and result in hallucinated reasoning paths and answers\\n(Nguyen et al., 2024). To address these issues, we utilize knowledge graphs (KGs) to guide LLMs\\ntoward faithful reasoning.\\nKG-enhanced Reasoning utilizes the structured knowledge in KGs to improve the reasoning of\\nLLMs (Luo et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2024), which can generally be expressed as finding a reasoning\\npath wz on KGs that connects the entities mentioned in the question and the answer. This can be\\nformulated as\\nP(a|q, G) =\\nX\\nwz\\nPϕ(a|q, wz)Pϕ(wz|q, G),\\n(2)\\nwhere Pϕ(wz|q, G) denotes the probability of discovering a reasoning path wz on KGs G given the\\nquestion q by a function parameterized by ϕ. To acquire reasoning paths for reasoning, most prior\\nstudies follow the retrieval-based (Li et al., 2023) or agent-based paradigm (Sun et al., 2024), as\\nshown in Figure 2 (a) and (b), respectively. Nevertheless, retrieval-based methods rely on precise\\nadditional retrievers, while agent-based methods are computationally intensive and lead to high\\nlatency. To address these issues, we propose a novel graph-constrained reasoning paradigm (GCR).\\nGraph-constrained Reasoning (GCR) directly incorporates KGs into the decoding process of\\nLLMs to achieve faithful reasoning. The overall framework of GCR is illustrated in Figure 2 (c),\\nwhich consists of three main components: 1) Knowledge Graph Trie Construction: building a\\nstructural index of KG to guide LLM reasoning, 2) Graph-constrained Decoding: generating KG-\\ngrounded paths and hypothesis answers using LLMs, and 3) Graph Inductive Reasoning: reasoning\\nover multiple paths and hypotheses to derive final answers.\\n4.2\\nKNOWLEDGE GRAPH TRIE CONSTRUCTION\\nKnowledge graphs (KGs) store abundant knowledge in a structured format. However, large language\\nmodels (LLMs) struggle to efficiently access and reason on KGs due to their unstructured nature. To\\naddress this issue, we propose to convert KGs into knowledge graph Tries (KG-Tries), which serve\\nas a structured index of KGs to facilitate efficient reasoning on graphs using LLMs.\\nA Trie (a.k.a. prefix tree) (Wikipedia contributors, 2024; Fredkin, 1960) is a tree-like data structure\\nthat stores a dynamic set of strings, where each node represents a common prefix of its children.\\nTries can be used to restrict LLM output tokens to those starting with valid prefixes (De Cao et al.,\\n2022; Xie et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2022). The tree structure of Trie is an ideal choice for encoding\\nthe reasoning paths in KGs for LLMs to efficiently traverse.\\nWe first adopt the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to retrieve reasoning paths Wz within L hops\\nstarting from entities mentioned in the questions. The retrieved paths are formatted as sentences\\nusing the template shown in Figure 7. The formatted sentences are then split into tokens by the\\n4\\ntokenizer of LLM and stored as a KG-Trie CG. The overall process can be formulated as:\\nWz = BFS(G, {eq}, L),\\n(3)\\nTz = Tokenizer(Wz),\\n(4)\\nCG = Trie(Tz),\\n(5)\\nwhere eq denotes the entities mentioned in the question, L denotes the maximum hops of paths, and\\nTz denotes the tokens of reasoning paths. The KG-Trie CG is used as a constraint to guide the LLM\\ndecoding process.\\nBy constructing KG-Trie for each question entity, we can enable efficient traversal of reasoning paths\\nin constant time (O(|Wz|)) without costly graph traversal (Sun et al., 2024). Moreover, KG-Trie can\\nbe pre-constructed offline and loaded during reasoning. This significantly reduces the computational\\ncost and latency of reasoning on KGs, making it feasible for real-time applications.\\n============================= Prompt Input ================================\\nPlease generate some reasoning paths in the KG starting from the topic entities to answer the question.\\n# Question: what is the name of justin bieber brother?\\n============================= LLM Output ================================\\n# Reasoning Path: <PATH> Justin Bieber →people.person.parents →Jeremy Bieber →peo-\\nple.person.children →Jaxon Bieber </PATH>\\n# Answer: Jaxon Bieber\\nFigure 3: An example of the graph-constrained decoding. Detailed prompts can be found in Figure 8.\\n4.3\\nGRAPH-CONSTRAINED DECODING\\nLarge language models (LLMs) have strong reasoning capabilities but still suffer from severe hal-\\nlucination issues, which undermines the trustworthiness of the reasoning process. To tackle this\\nissue, we propose graph-constrained decoding, which unifies the reasoning ability of LLMs with the\\nstructured knowledge in KGs to generate faithful KG-grounded reasoning paths leading to answers.\\nGiven a question q, we design an instruction prompt to harness the reasoning ability of LLMs to\\ngenerate reasoning paths wz and hypothesis answers a. To eliminate the hallucination during rea-\\nsoning on KGs, we adopt the KG-Trie CG as constraints to guide the decoding process of LLMs and\\nonly generate reasoning paths that are valid in KGs, formulated as:\\nPϕ(a, wz|q) = Pϕ(a|q, wz)\\n|\\n{z\\n}\\nRegular decoding\\nGraph-constrained decoding\\nz\\n}|\\n{\\n|wz|\\nY\\ni=1\\nPϕ(wzi|q, wz1:i−1)CG(wzi|wz1:i−1),\\n(6)\\nCG(wzi|wz1:i−1) =\\n\\x1a1, ∃prefix(wz1:i, wz), ∃wz ∈Wz,\\n0, else,\\n(7)\\nwhere wzi denotes the i-th token of the reasoning path wz, Pϕ denotes the token probabilities\\npredicted by the LLM with parameters ϕ, and CG(wzi|wz1:i−1) denotes the constraint function that\\nchecks whether the generated tokens wz1:i is a valid prefix of the reasoning path using KG-Trie.\\nAfter a valid reasoning path is generated, we switch back to the regular decoding process to generate\\na hypothesis answer conditioned on the path.\\nTo further enhance KG reasoning ability, we fine-tune a lightweight KG-specialized LLM with\\nparameters ϕ on the graph-constrained decoding task. Specifically, given a question q, the LLM is\\noptimized to generate relevant reasoning paths wz that are helpful for answering the question, then\\nprovide a hypothesis answer a based on it, which can be formulated as:\\nL = E(q,wz,a)∼DG log Pϕ(a, wz|q) = E\\n\\uf8ee\\n\\uf8f0log\\n|a|\\nY\\ni=1\\nPϕ(ai|q, wz, a1:i−1)\\n|wz|\\nY\\nj=1\\nPϕ(wzj|q, wz1:j−1)\\n\\uf8f9\\n\\uf8fb,\\n(8)\\nwhere ai and wzj denote the i-th token of the answer a and the j-th token of the reasoning path wz,\\nrespectively.\\n5\\nThe training data (q, wz, a) ∈DG consists of question-answer pairs and reasoning paths generated\\nfrom KGs. We use the shortest paths connecting the entities in the question and answer as the\\nreasoning path wz for training, where details can be found in Section 7. An example of graph-\\nconstrained decoding is illustrated in Figure 3, where <PATH> and </PATH> are special tokens\\nto control the start and end of graph-constrained decoding. Experiment results in Section 5.2 show\\nthat even a lightweight KG-specialized LLM (0.5B) can achieve satisfactory performance in KG\\nreasoning.\\nThe graph-constrained decoding method differs from retrieval-based methods by integrating a pre-\\nconstructed KG-Trie into the decoding process of LLMs. This not only reduces input tokens, but\\nalso bridges the gap between unstructured reasoning in LLMs and structured knowledge in KGs,\\nallowing for efficient reasoning on KGs regardless of its scale, which results in faithful reasoning\\nleading to answers. Additionally, experimental results in Section 5.4 demonstrate that KG-Trie can\\nintegrate with new KGs on the fly, showcasing its zero-shot generalizability for reasoning on unseen\\nKGs without further training.\\n4.4\\nGRAPH INDUCTIVE REASONING\\nGraph-constrained decoding harnesses the reasoning ability of a KG-specialized LLM to generate a\\nfaithful reasoning path and a hypothesis answer. However, complex reasoning tasks typically admit\\nmultiple reasoning paths that lead to correct answers (Stanovich et al., 2000). Incorporating diverse\\nreasoning paths would be beneficial for deliberate thinking and reasoning (Evans, 2010; Wang et al.,\\n2024). To this end, we propose to input multiple reasoning paths and hypothesis answers generated\\nby the KG-specialized LLM into a powerful general LLM to leverage its inductive reasoning ability\\nto produce final answers.\\nThe graph-constrained decoding seamlessly integrates into the decoding process of LLMs, allowing\\nit to be paired with various LLM generation strategies like beam-search (Federico et al., 1995) to\\ntake advantage of the GPU parallel computation. Thus, given a question, we adopt graph-constrained\\ndecoding to simultaneously generate K reasoning paths and hypothesis answers with beam search in\\na single LLM call, which are then inputted into a general LLM to derive final answers. The overall\\nprocess can be formulated as:\\nZK = {ak, wk\\nz}K\\nk=1 = arg top-K Pϕ(a, wz|q),\\n(9)\\nPθ(A|q, ZK) ≃\\nK\\nY\\nk=1\\nPθ(A|q, ak, wk\\nz),\\n(10)\\nwhere θ denotes the parameters of the general LLM, ZK denotes the set of top-K reasoning paths\\nand hypothesis answers, and A denotes the final answers.\\nWe follow the FiD framework (Izacard & Grave, 2021; Singh et al., 2021) to incorporate multiple\\nreasoning paths and hypothesis answers to conduct inductive reasoning within one LLM call, i.e.,\\nPθ(A|q, ZK), where detailed prompts can be found in Figure 9. The general LLM can be any\\npowerful LLM, such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022), or Llama-3 (Meta, 2024), which can effectively\\nleverage their internal reasoning ability to reason over multiple reasoning paths to produce final\\nanswers without additional fine-tuning.\\n5\\nEXPERIMENT\\nIn our experiments, we aim to answer the following research questions: RQ1: Can GCR achieve\\nstate-of-the-art reasoning performance with balances between efficiency and effectiveness? RQ2:\\nCan GCR eliminate hallucinations and conduct faithful reasoning? RQ3: Can GCR generalize to\\nunseen KGs on the fly?\\n5.1\\nEXPERIMENT SETUPS\\nDatasets. Following previous research (Luo et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2024), we first evaluate the\\nreasoning ability of GCR on two benchmark KGQA datasets: WebQuestionSP (WebQSP) (Yih et al.,\\n2016) and Complex WebQuestions (CWQ) (Talmor & Berant, 2018).

To further evaluate the generalizability\\nof GCR, we conduct zero-shot transfer experiments on two new KGQA datasets: CommonsenseQA\\n(CSQA) (Talmor et al., 2019) and MedQA-USMLE (MedQA) (Jin et al., 2021). For CSQA, we use\\nConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017) as the KG, while for MedQA, we use a medical KG constructed\\nfrom the Unified Medical Language System (Yasunaga et al., 2021). The details of the datasets are\\ndescribed in Section 7.\\nBaselines. We compare GCR with the 22 baselines grouped into three categories: 1) LLM reasoning\\nmethods, 2) graph reasoning methods, and 3) KG-enhanced LLM reasoning methods. The detailed\\nbaselines are listed in Section 8.\\nEvaluation Metrics. We adopt Hit and F1 as the evaluation metrics following previous works (Luo\\net al., 2024; Sun et al., 2024) on WebQSP and CWQ. Hit checks whether any correct answer exists in\\nthe generated predictions, while F1 considers the coverage of all answers by balancing the precision\\nand recall of predictions. Because CSQA and MedQA are multiple-choice QA datasets, we adopt\\naccuracy as the evaluation metric.\\nImplementations. For GCR, we use the KG-Trie to index all the reasoning paths within 2 hops\\nstarting from question entities. For the LLMs, we use a fine-tuned Llama-3-8B (Meta, 2024) as\\nthe KG-specialized LLM. We generate top-10 reasoning paths and hypothesis answers from graph-\\nconstrained decoding. We adopt the advanced ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022) and GPT-4o-mini (OpenAI,\\n2024a) as the general LLMs for inductive reasoning. The detailed hyperparameters and experiment\\nsettings are described in Section 9.\\n5.2\\nRQ1: REASONING PERFORMANCE AND EFFICIENCY\\nMain Results. In this section, we compare GCR with other baselines on KGQA benchmarks to\\nevaluate the reasoning performance. From the results shown in Table 1, GCR achieves the best\\nperformance on both datasets, outperforming the second-best by 2.1% and 9.1% in terms of Hit on\\nWebQSP and CWQ, respectively. The results demonstrate that GCR can effectively leverage KGs to\\nenhance LLMs and achieve state-of-the-art reasoning performance.\\nAmong the LLM reasoning methods, ChatGPT with self-consistency prompts demonstrates the best\\nperformance, which indicates the powerful reasoning ability inherent in LLMs. However, their per-\\nformances are still limited by the model size and complex reasoning required over structured data.\\nGraph reasoning methods, such as ReaRev, achieve competitive performance on WebQSP by ex-\\n7\\nTable 2: Efficiency and performance comparison of different methods on WebQSP.\\nTypes\\nMethods\\nHit\\nAvg.

But they struggle to generalize across different datasets and\\nunderperform on CWQ. In KG+LLM methods, both agent-based methods (e.g., ToG, EffiQA) and\\nretrieval-based methods (e.g., RoG, GNN-RAG) achieve the second-best performance. Neverthe-\\nless, they still suffer from inefficiency and reasoning hallucinations which limit their performance.\\nIn contrast, GCR effectively eliminates hallucinations and conducts faithful reasoning by leveraging\\nthe structured KG index and graph-constrained decoding.\\nEfficiency Analysis.\\nTo show the efficiency of GCR, we compare the average runtime, number of LLM calls, and num-\\nber of input tokens with retrieval-based and agent-based methods in Table 2. For retrieval-based\\nmethods, we compare with dense retrievers (e.g., S-Bert (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019), BGE (Zhang\\net al., 2023), OpenAI-Emb. (OpenAI, 2024b)) and graph-based retrievers (e.g., GNN-RAG (Mavro-\\nmatis & Karypis, 2024), RoG (Luo et al., 2024)), which retrieve reasoning paths from KGs and feed\\nthem into LLMs for reasoning answers. For agent-based methods, we compare with ToG (Sun et al.,\\n2024) and EffiQA1 (Dong et al., 2024), which heuristically search on KGs for answers. The detailed\\nsettings are described in Section 9.\\nDense retrievers are most efficient in terms of runtime and LLM calls as they convert all paths into\\nsentences and encode them as embeddings in advance. However, they sacrifice their accuracy in\\nretrieving as they are not designed to encode graph structure. Graph-based retrievers and agent-\\nbased methods achieve better performance by considering graph structure; however, they require\\nmore time and LLM calls. Specifically, the retrieved graph is fed as inputs to LLMs, which leads to\\na large number of input tokens. Agent-based methods, like ToG, require more LLM calls and input\\ntokens as the question difficulty increases due to their iterative reasoning process. In contrast, GCR\\nachieves the best performance with a reasonable runtime and number of LLM calls. With the help\\nof KG-Trie, GCR explores multiple reasoning paths at the same time during the graph-constrained\\ndecoding, which does not involve additional LLM calls or input tokens and benefits from the parallel\\nGPU computation with low latency. More efficiency analysis under different beam sizes used for\\ngraph-constrained decoding can be found in parameter analysis.\\nTable 3: Ablation studies of GCR on two KGQA datasets.\\nVariants\\nWebQSP\\nCWQ\\nF1\\nPrecision\\nRecall\\nF1\\nPrecision\\nRecall\\nGCR (Llama-3.1-8B + ChatGPT)\\n73.2\\n80.0\\n76.9\\n60.9\\n61.1\\n66.6\\nGCR w/o KG-specialized LLM\\n52.9\\n66.3\\n50.2\\n37.5\\n40.8\\n37.9\\nGCR w/o General LLM\\n57.0\\n58.0\\n70.1\\n39.4\\n32.8\\n64.3\\nAblation Study. We first conduct an\\nablation study to analyze the effec-\\ntiveness of the KG-specialized LLM\\nand general LLM in GCR. As shown\\nin Table 3, the full GCR achieves the\\nbest performance on both datasets.\\nBy removing the KG-specialized LLM, we feed all 2-hop reasoning paths into the general LLM.\\nThis results in a significant performance drop, indicating its importance in utilizing reasoning abil-\\nity to find relevant paths on KGs for reasoning. On the other hand, removing the general LLM\\nand relying solely on answers predicted by KG-specialized LLM leads to a noticeable decrease in\\nprecision, due to noises in its predictions. This highlighting the necessity of the general LLM for\\nconducting inductive reasoning over multiple paths to derive final answers.\\nDifferent LLMs. We further analyze LLMs used for KG-specialized and general LLMs in Table 4.\\nFor KG-specialized LLMs, we directly plug the KG-Trie into different LLMs to conduct graph-\\nconstrained decoding and use the same general LLM for final reasoning. For general LLMs, we\\nadopt the same reasoning paths generated by KG-specialized LLMs to different LLMs to produce\\nfinal answers.

We conduct the experiments on\\nWebQSP with different beam sizes of 1, 3, 5, 10, and 20.\\nThe results are shown in Figure 4. We observe that the hit\\nand recall of GCR increase with the beam size. Because,\\nwith a larger beam size, the LLMs can explore more rea-\\nsoning paths and find the correct answers. However, the\\nF1 score, peaks when the beam size is set to 10. This is\\nbecause the beam size of 10 can provide a balance be-\\ntween the exploration and exploitation of the reasoning\\npaths. When the beam size is set to 20, the performance\\ndrops due to the increased complexity of the search space,\\nwhich may introduce noise and make the reasoning less\\nreliable. This also highlights the importance of using general LLMs to conduct inductive reason-\\ning over multiple paths to disregard the noise and find the correct answers. Although the graph-\\nconstrained decoding benefits from the parallel GPU computation to explore multiple reasoning\\npaths at the same time, the time cost still slightly increases from 1.4s to 7.8s with the increase of\\nthe beam size. Thus, we set the beam size to 10 in the experiments to balance the performance and\\nefficiency. We also investigate the impact of L hops paths used for KG-Trie construction in Sec-\\ntion 10.1. The results show that GCR can achieve a good balance between reasoning performance\\nand efficiency by setting L = 2 and K = 10.\\n5.3\\nRQ2: HALLUCINATION ELIMINATION AND FAITHFUL REASONING\\nIn this section, we investigate the effectiveness of KG constraints in eliminating hallucinations and\\nensuring faithful reasoning. We first compare the difference of answer accuracy (Hit) and faithful\\nreasoning ratio by removing KG constraints in graph-constrained decoding. The faithful reasoning\\nratio is calculated as the percentage of faithful reasoning in correctly predicted answers. We define\\na reasoning as faithful where the generated reasoning path can be found in KGs, and vice versa.\\nGCR GCR w/o constraint\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\nAnswer Hit\\n100.0%\\n62.4%\\nWebQSP\\nFaithful Reasoning\\nError Reasoning\\nGCR GCR w/o constraint\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\nAnswer Hit\\n100.0%\\n48.1%\\nCWQ\\nFigure 5: Analysis of performance and reasoning\\nerrors in GCR.\\nFrom the Figure 5, we can observe that GCR\\nachieves the 100% faithful reasoning ratio on\\nboth datasets, which indicates that GCR can\\neliminate hallucinations and ensure faithful rea-\\nsoning during reasoning on KGs. In contrast,\\nwhen removing KG constraints, both the an-\\nswer accuracy and faithful reasoning decrease\\nsignificantly on WebQSP. This shows that KG\\nconstraints not only improve reasoning by re-\\nducing the searching space, but also play a cru-\\ncial role in preventing hallucinations for accu-\\n9\\nTable 5: Examples of the faithful reasoning conducted by GCR. Red denotes the incorrect reasoning\\npaths and answers, while bold denotes the correct paths and answers.\\nCase 1: Incorrect answers and hallucinated reasoning paths without constraints.\\nQuestion\\nWho is niall ferguson ’s wife?\\nAnswer\\nAyaan Hirsi Ali\\nGCR w/o constraint\\n# Reasoning Path: Niall Ferguson →people.person.children →Mabel Rose Ferguson →\\npeople.person.parents →Alyssa Mastromonaco\\n#Answer: Alyssa Mastromonaco\\nGCR\\n# Reasoning Path: Niall Ferguson →people.person.children →Thomas Ferguson →peo-\\nple.person.parents →Ayaan Hirsi Ali\\n#Answer: Ayaan Hirsi Ali\\nCase 2: Correct answers but hallucinated reasoning paths without constraints.\\nQuestion\\nWhere is jamarcus russell from?\\nAnswer\\nMobile\\nGCR w/o constraint\\n# Reasoning Path: JaMarcus Russell →people.person.place of birth →Tampa\\n#Answer: Mobile, Alabama\\nGCR\\n# Reasoning Path: JaMarcus Russell →people.person.place of birth →Mobile\\n#Answer: Mobile\\nrate reasoning. While the answer hit rate on CWQ remains almost unchanged, the ratio of faithful\\nreasoning still decreases to 48.1%. This implies that even if LLMs can produce correct answers, the\\nreasoning process is still prone to hallucinations and cannot be trusted, which is aligned with the\\nfindings in previous studies (Nguyen et al., 2024).\\nCase Study. We further provide a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of GCR in eliminating\\nhallucinations and ensuring faithful reasoning. As shown in Table 5, the first case demonstrates that,\\nwithout constraints, the model generates an incorrect reasoning path leading to an incorrect answer\\nby hallucinating facts such as “Mabel Rose Ferguson is the child of Naill Ferguson and her parent\\nis Alyssa Mastromonaco”. In contrast, GCR generates a faithful reasoning path grounded in KGs\\nthat “Naill Ferguson has a child named Thomas Ferguson who has a parent named Ayaan Hirsi Ali”.\\nBased on the paths we can reason the correct answer to the question is “Ayaan Hirsi Ali”. In the\\nsecond case, although the LLM answers the question correctly, the generated reasoning path is still\\nhallucinated with incorrect facts. Conversely, GCR conducts faithful reasoning with both correct\\nanswer and reasoning path. These results demonstrate that GCR can effectively eliminate hallucina-\\ntions and ensure faithful reasoning by leveraging KG constraints in graph-constrained decoding.\\n5.4\\nRQ3: ZERO-SHOT GENERALIZABILITY TO UNSEEN KGS\\nTable 6: Zero-shot transferabil-\\nity to other KGQA datasets.\\nModel\\nCSQA\\nMedQA\\nChatGPT\\n79\\n64\\nGCR (ChatGPT)\\n85\\n66\\nGPT-4o-mini\\n91\\n75\\nGCR (GPT-4o-mini)\\n94\\n79\\nIn GCR, the knowledge graph is converted into a constraint which\\nis plugged into the decoding process of LLMs. This allows GCR\\nto generalize to unseen KGs without further training. To evaluate\\nthe generalizability of GCR, we conduct zero-shot transfer ex-\\nperiments on two unseen KGQA datasets: CSQA (Talmor et al.,\\n2019) and MedQA (Jin et al., 2021). Specifically, we use the\\nsame KG-specialized LLM (Llama-3.1-8B) trained on Freebase\\nas well as two general LLMs (ChatGP, GPT-4o-mini). During\\nreasoning, we directly plug the KG-Trie constructed from ConceptNet and medical KGs into the\\nGCR to conduct graph-constrained decoding without additional fine-tuning. The results are shown\\nin Table 6.\\nFrom the results, it is evident that GCR outperforms ChatGPT and GPT-4o-mini in zero-shot per-\\nformance on both datasets. Specifically, GCR shows a 7.6% increase in accuracy on CSQA and a\\n3.1% improvement on MedQA compared to ChatGPT. This highlights the strong zero-shot general-\\nizability of its graph reasoning capabilities to unseen KGs without additional training. However, the\\nimprovement on MedQA is not as significant as that on CSQA. We hypothesize this difference may\\nbe due to LLMs having more common sense knowledge, which aids in reasoning on common sense\\nknowledge graphs effectively. On the other hand, medical KGs are more specialized and require\\ndomain-specific knowledge for reasoning, potentially limiting the generalizability of our method.\\n10\\n6\\nCONCLUSION\\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel LLM reasoning paradigm called graph-constrained reasoning\\n(GCR) to eliminate hallucination and ensure faithful reasoning by incorporating structured KGs. To\\nbridge the unstructured reasoning in LLMs with the structured knowledge in KGs, we propose a\\nKG-Trie to encode paths in KGs using a trie-based index. KG-Trie constrains the decoding process\\nto guide a KG-specialized LLM to generate faithful reasoning paths grounded in KGs. By impos-\\ning constraints, we can not only eliminate hallucination in reasoning but also reduce the reasoning\\ncomplexity, contributing to more efficient and accurate reasoning. Last, a powerful general LLM is\\nutilized as a complement to inductively reason over multiple reasoning paths to generate the final\\nanswer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GCR excels in faithful reasoning and generalizes\\nwell to reason on new KGs without additional fine-tuning.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nWe would want to express our sincere gratitude to Yuan-Fang Li for his valuable feedback and\\nsuggestions during the preparation of this work.\\nREFERENCES\\nGarima Agrawal, Tharindu Kumarage, Zeyad Alghamdi, and Huan Liu.

To compare the reasoning performance with existing methods, we use two bench-\\nmark KGQA datasets in this study: WebQuestionSP (WebQSP) (Yih et al., 2016) and Complex We-\\nbQuestions (CWQ) (Talmor & Berant, 2018). To ensure fairness, we adopt the same train and test\\nsplits as previous works (Jiang et al., 2022; Luo et al., 2024). Details of the datasets can be found in\\nTable 7.\\nBoth WebQSP and CWQ can be reasoned using Freebase KGs2 (Bollacker et al., 2008). To reduce\\nthe size of the KGs, we use a subgraph of Freebase by extracting all triples that start from question\\nentities within the maximum reasoning hops provided by previous works3 (Luo et al., 2024). The\\nstatistics of the knowledge graphs are shown in Table 9.\\nFine-tuning Datasets. To enhance the KG reasoning ability of LLMs, we construct fine-tuning\\ndatasets by generating reasoning paths from the KGs. Specifically, we adopt the training split of\\nWebQSP and CWQ, which contain 2,826 and 27,639 question-answer pairs, respectively. For each\\nquestion, we find all the shortest reasoning paths on KGs that connect the question entity to the\\nanswer entity. We then convert the reasoning paths into formatted strings and pair them with the\\nquestion-answer pairs with the template shown in Figure 8 to form the fine-tuning datasets. Since\\nthere could be multiple reasoning paths for a question, we generate multiple training instances paired\\nwith different reasoning paths for each question-answer pair. The fine-tuning datasets contain 28,307\\nand 181,602 question-reasoning path-answer triples for WebQSP and CWQ, respectively. The statis-\\ntics of the fine-tuning datasets are shown in Table 8.\\nZero-shot Generalization Datasets.\\nTo evaluate the transferability of GCR, we further select\\ntwo new KGQA datasets4: CommonsenseQA (CSQA) (Talmor et al., 2019) and MedQA-USMLE\\n(MedQA) (Jin et al., 2021). CSQA is a 5-way multiple choice QA dataset that involves reasoning\\nwith commonsense knowledge. MedQA is a 4-way multiple choice QA task that requires biomed-\\nical and clinical knowledge. For CSQA, we use the ConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017), which is a\\ngeneral-purpose KG that contains commonsense knowledge. For MedQA, we use a medical KG\\n2https://github.com/microsoft/FastRDFStore\\n3WebQSP: https://huggingface.co/datasets/rmanluo/RoG-webqsp, CWQ: https://\\nhuggingface.co/datasets/rmanluo/RoG-cwq\\n4https://github.com/michiyasunaga/qagnn\\n15\\nconstructed from the Unified Medical Language System (Yasunaga et al., 2021). The statistics of\\nthe knowledge graphs are shown in Table 9. We respectively select 100 questions from each dataset.\\nFor each question, following previous studies (Feng et al., 2020; Yasunaga et al., 2021), a 2-hop\\nsubgraph is extracted from the KGs to form the zero-shot generalization datasets.\\nTable 7: Statistics of datasets.\\nDataset\\nDataset Statistics\\nStatistics of Answer Numbers\\n#Train\\n#Test\\n#Ans = 1\\n2 ≥#Ans ≤4\\n5 ≥#Ans ≤9\\n#Ans ≥10\\nWebQSP\\n2,826\\n1,628\\n51.2%\\n27.4%\\n8.3%\\n12.1%\\nCWQ\\n27,639\\n3,531\\n70.6%\\n19.4%\\n6%\\n4%\\nTable 8: Statistics of fine-tuning datasets for graph-constrained decoding.\\nTotal\\nWebQSP\\nCWQ\\n209,909\\n28,307\\n181,602\\nTable 9: Statistics of constructed knowledge graphs.\\nKG\\n#Entities\\n#Relations\\n#Triples\\nFreebase\\n2,566,291\\n7,058\\n8,309,195\\nConceptNet\\n799,273\\n17\\n2,151,303\\nMedKG\\n9,958\\n15\\n49,974\\n8\\nBASELINES\\nWe compare GCR with the 22 baselines grouped into three categories: 1) LLM reasoning methods,\\n2) graph reasoning methods, and 3) KG-enhanced LLM reasoning methods.

Specifically, we consider the following baselines:\\n• Qwen2-0.5B/1.5B.7B (Yang et al., 2024a) provides a series of pre-trained LLMs with dif-\\nferent sizes, including 0.5B, 1.5B, and 7B parameters.\\n• Llama-2-7B (Touvron et al., 2023) is a large-scale LLM pre-trained on a diverse range of\\ntasks.\\n• Llama-3.1-8B (Meta, 2024) is the updated version of Llama-2 with more powerful reason-\\ning capabilities.\\n• ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022) is a powerful closed-source LLM that could follow instructions\\nto conduct complex tasks.\\n• GPT-4o-mini (OpenAI, 2024a) is the new flagship model of OpenAI that could reason\\nacross different modalities and tasks.\\n• Few-shot prompt (Brown et al., 2020) is a few-shot learning method that provides LLMs\\nwith a few examples in the prompts to conduct reasoning.\\n• CoT (Wei et al., 2022) is a chain-of-thought reasoning method that prompts LLMs to gen-\\nerate a chain of reasoning steps.\\n• Self-consistency (Wang et al., 2024) generates multiple reasoning paths and selects the\\nmost consistent answer.\\n16\\nGraph reasoning methods focus on reasoning on KGs using graph neural networks (GNNs) (Wu\\net al., 2020) or graph-based reasoning mechanisms. We include the following baselines:\\n• GraftNet (Sun et al., 2018) is a graph-based reasoning method that retrieves relevant sub-\\ngraphs from KGs with entity linking.\\n• NSM (He et al., 2021) utilizes the sequential model to mimic the multi-hop reasoning\\nprocess on KGs.\\n• SR+NSM (Zhang et al., 2022) proposes a relation-path retrieval to retrieve subgraphs for\\nmulti-hop reasoning.\\n• ReaRev (Mavromatis & Karypis, 2022) is a GNN-based method that reasons on KGs by\\nconsidering complex graph information.\\nKG-enhanced LLM reasoning methods incorporate KGs to enhance the reasoning abilities of\\nLLMs which can be further divided into retrieval-based and agent-based paradigms. We include the\\nfollowing baselines:\\nRetrieval-based methods retrieve relevant facts from KGs with an external retriever and then feed\\nthem into the inputs of LLMs for reasoning:\\n• KD-CoT (Wang et al., 2023) retrieves relevant knowledge from KGs to generate faithful\\nreasoning plans for LLMs.\\n• EWEK-QA (Dehghan et al., 2024) enriches the retrieved knowledge by searching from\\nboth KGs and web.\\n• RoG (Luo et al., 2024) proposes a planning-retrieval-reasoning framework that retrieves\\nreasoning paths from KGs to guide LLMs conducting faithful reasoning.\\n• GNN-RAG (Mavromatis & Karypis, 2024) adopts a lightweight graph neural network to\\neffectively retrieve from KGs.\\n• GNN-RAG+RA (Mavromatis & Karypis, 2024) combines the retrieval results of both RoG\\nand GNN-RAG to enhance the reasoning performance.\\nAgent-based methods treat LLMs as agents that iteratively interact with KGs to find reasoning paths\\nand answers:\\n• ToG (Sun et al., 2024) conducts the reasoning on KGs by exploring multiple paths and\\nconcludes the final answer by aggregating the evidence from them.\\n• EffiQA (Jiang et al., 2024) proposes an efficient agent-based method to reason on KGs.\\n9\\nIMPLEMENTATION DETAILS AND EXPERIMENT SETTINGS\\nIn this section, we will detail the implementation of GCR as well as the experiment settings.\\nFine-tuning KG-specialized LLMs. We fine-tune several lightweight LLMs ranging from 0.5B to\\n8B (Yang et al., 2024a; Touvron et al., 2023; Meta, 2024) on the fine-tuning datasets for 3 epochs.\\nThe batch size is set to 4 and the learning rate is set to 2e-5. We use the cosine learning rate scheduler\\npolicy with the warmup ratio set to 0.03. The training is conducted on 2 A100-80G GPUs for each\\nmodel. The training time and memory usage are shown in Table 10.\\nKGQA Experiment Settings. The KGQA experiment shown in Table 1 aims to compare the rea-\\nsoning performance of GCR with existing methods. For our method, we use the fine-tuned Llama-\\n3.1-8B as KG-specialized LLMs, the general LLM is selected as ChatGPT and GPT-4o-mini. The\\nKG-Trie is constructed from the subgraph of Freebase KGs. The maximum reasoning hops are set\\nto 2 for both WebQSP and CWQ. The beam size is set to 10 for graph-constrained decoding. For\\nvanilla LLMs baselines, we use the zero-shot prompting to ask the models to answer the questions.\\nFor other baselines, we strictly check whether the original papers follow the same settings and copy\\nthe results for fair comparison.\\nEfficiency Analysis Settings. The efficiency analysis shown in Table 2 aims to compare the effi-\\nciency and performance of different methods on WebQSP. For GCR, we use the same settings as the\\n17\\nTable 10: Training time and memory usage for different KG-specialized LLMs.\\nModel\\nTime\\nMem.

For dense retriever methods (e.g., S-Bert (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019), BGE\\n(Zhang et al., 2023), OpenAI-Emb. (OpenAI, 2024b)), we first search all paths within 2-hops on the\\nKGs which are formatted as sentences with the template in Figure 7. Then, we adopt the embedding\\nmodel to encode the path sentences as embeddings which are stored in a vector database. During in-\\nference, we retrieve 10 paths from the vector database with the question as query and feed them into\\nthe LLMs for reasoning. For GNN-RAG (Mavromatis & Karypis, 2024) and RoG (Luo et al., 2024),\\nwe strictly follow the original papers to retrieve reasoning paths and conduct the experiments. For\\nagent-based methods (e.g., ToG (Sun et al., 2024)), we use the same settings detailed in the original\\npapers. For EffiQA (Jiang et al., 2024), since there is no available code, we directly copy the results\\nfrom the original paper.\\nThe average runtime is measured by the time taken to answer the questions. The average number\\nof LLM calls is the number of times the LLMs are called to answer the questions. The average\\nnumber of LLM tokens is the number of tokens inputted into LLMs to answer the questions, such\\nas questions and retrieved reasoning paths. The experiments are conducted on a single A100-80G\\nGPU for each method.\\nAblation Study. In ablation study, we first try to analyze the effectiveness of different components in\\nGCR. We conduct the experiments on WebQSP and CWQ datasets. By removing the KG-specialized\\nLLM (w/o KG-specialized LLM), we search all the 2-hop paths starting from question entities and\\nfeed them into the general LLMs for reasoning. By removing the general LLM (w/o general LLM),\\nwe directly use the hypothesis answers generated by the KG-specialized LLMs as the final answers.\\nDifferent LLMs. We also analyze the different LLMs used for KG-specialized LLMs and general\\nLLMs on WebQSP. For KG-specialized LLMs, we first use the vanilla LLMs with different learning\\ntypes (i.e., zero-shot and few-shot prompting). For zero-shot prompting, we directly ask the models\\nto generate the reasoning paths with the constraints. For few-shot prompting, we provide the models\\nwith a few examples in the prompts to conduct path generation. Detailed prompts can be found in\\nFigures 8 and 10. Then, we fine-tune the lightweight LLMs with different sizes (0.5B to 8B) on the\\ngraph-constrained decoding task. For general LLMs, we use the vanilla LLMs to directly conduct\\nreasoning over multiple reasoning paths. The detailed reasoning prompts can be found in Figure 9.\\nParameter Analysis. We first analyze the performance of GCR with different beam sizes for graph-\\nconstrained decoding. We conduct the experiments on the WebQSP datasets with beam sizes of 1, 3,\\n5, 10, and 20. Then, we analyze the performance of GCR with different hops of paths encoded in the\\nKG-Trie. We conduct the experiments on the WebQSP datasets with maximum paths hops ranging\\nfrom 1 to 4.\\nFaithful Reasoning Analysis. We investigate the effect of the KG constraints on ensuring faithful\\nreasoning. We adopt the fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B as KG-specialized LLMs. Then, we compare\\nthe faithful reasoning rate and answer hit of GCR with and without the KG constraints in graph-\\nconstrained decoding. The faithful reasoning rate is the percentage of the faithful reasoning in the\\ncorrectly predicted answers. A reasoning path is considered faithful if it can be found in the KGs,\\nand vice versa. The answer hit is the percentage of the correct answers in the predictions.\\nZero-shot Generalization Analysis. We evaluate the transferability of GCR on two zero-shot gen-\\neralization datasets: CSQA and MedQA. We use the fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B as KG-specialized\\nLLMs and ChatGPT as well as GPT-4o-mini as the general LLMs. The KG-Trie is constructed\\nfrom the subgraph of ConceptNet and MedKG. The maximum reasoning hops are set to 2 for both\\ndatasets. The beam size is set to 10 for graph-constrained decoding. For vanilla LLMs baselines\\n18\\n(i.e., ChatGPT and GPT-4o-mini), we use the zero-shot prompting to ask the models to answer the\\nquestions.\\n10\\nADDITIONAL EXPERIMENT RESULTS\\n10.1\\nPERFORMANCE ON DIFFERENT HOPS\\nIn this section, we analyze the impact of different hops of reasoning paths on the performance of\\nGCR. We conduct the experiments on WebQSP with different maximum hops of reasoning paths\\nencoded in the KG-Trie. The results are shown in Figure 6. We observe that the performance\\nof GCR increases with the number of hops of reasoning paths. The performance peaks when the\\nmaximum hops of reasoning paths are set to 2. This is because the 2-hop paths can provide sufficient\\ninformation for the LLMs to conduct reasoning. When the hops are set to 3 or 4, the performance\\ndrops due to the increased complexity of the reasoning paths, which may introduce noise and make\\nthe reasoning less reliable. Additionally, the size of the KG-Trie slightly increases from 0.5 MB to\\n7.5 MB with the increase of the hops from 1 to 4. This indicates that the KG-Trie can be efficiently\\nconstructed with a small size and guide the LLMs to reason on graphs effectively.\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\nKG-Trie Path Length L\\n0\\n2\\n4\\n6\\nAvg.

The template for converting reasoning paths into natural language sen-\\ntences is shown in Figure 7, where the e∗and r∗denotes the entities and relations in a reasoning\\npath wz = e0\\nr1\\n−→e1\\nr2\\n−→. . .\\nrl\\n−→el,\\nPath Sentence Template\\n<PATH> e1 →r1 →e2 →. . . →rl →el </PATH>\\nFigure 7: The template for converting reasoning paths into formatted sentences.\\nGraph-constrained Decoding Prompt. The prompt for graph-constrained decoding is shown in\\nFigure 8, where the question and mentioned entities are provided to the LLMs to generate rea-\\nsoning paths and hypothesis answers. In the fine-tuning datasets, the supervised LLM outputs are\\nconstructed from the ground-truth answers and reasoning paths extracted from the KGs.\\n19\\nGraph-constrained Decoding Prompt\\n============================= Prompt Input ================================\\nReasoning path is a sequence of triples in the KG that connects the topic entities in the question to\\nanswer entities.

We provide a\\nfew examples in the prompts to guide the LLMs to generate reasoning paths. Since the LLMs with\\nfew-shot prompt learning are not fine-tuned on the graph-constrained decoding task, we only apply\\nthe constraint to generate reasoning paths.\\nGraph Inductive Reasoning Prompt. The prompt for graph inductive reasoning is shown in Fig-\\nure 9. We adopt the graph-constrained decoding to generate K reasoning paths and hypothesis\\nanswers for each question. The reasoning paths and hypothesis answers are provided to the general\\nLLMs to answer the questions without fine-tuning.\\nGraph Inductive Reasoning Prompt\\n============================= Prompt Input ================================\\n# Reasoning Paths:\\n<Reasoning Path 1><Hypothesis Answer 1>\\n. . .\\n<Reasoning Path K><Hypothesis Answer K>\\n# Question:\\n<Question>\\nBased on the reasoning paths, please answer the given question.

      "(GCR) to eliminate hallucination and ensure faithful reasoning by incorporating structured KGs. To\n",
      "bridge the unstructured reasoning in LLMs with the structured knowledge in KGs, we propose a\n",
      "KG-Trie to encode paths in KGs using a trie-based index. KG-Trie constrains the decoding process\n",
      "to guide a KG-specialized LLM to generate faithful reasoning paths grounded in KGs. By impos-\n",
      "ing constraints, we can not only eliminate hallucination in reasoning but also reduce the reasoning\n",
      "complexity, contributing to more efficient and accurate reasoning. Last, a powerful general LLM is\n",
      "utilized as a complement to inductively reason over multiple reasoning paths to generate the final\n",
      "answer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GCR excels in faithful reasoning and generalizes\n",
      "well to reason on new KGs without additional fine-tuning.\n",

To address these issues, knowledge graphs (KGs) have\\nbeen utilized to enhance LLM reasoning through their structured knowledge.\\nHowever, existing KG-enhanced methods, either retrieval-based or agent-based,\\nencounter difficulties in accurately retrieving knowledge and efficiently\\ntraversing KGs at scale.

However, LLMs still struggle with conducting faithful\\nreasoning due to issues of lack of knowledge and hallucination (Huang et al., 2024; Wang et al.,\\n2023). These issues result in factual errors and flawed reasoning processes (Nguyen et al., 2024),\\nwhich greatly undermine the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications.\\nTo address these issues, many studies utilize knowledge graphs (KGs), which encapsulate extensive\\nfactual information in a structured format, to improve the reasoning abilities of LLMs (Pan et al.,\\n2024; Luo et al., 2024). Nevertheless, because of the unstructured nature of LLMs, directly applying\\nthem to reason on KGs is challenging.\\nExisting KG-enhanced LLM reasoning methods can be roughly categorized into two groups:\\nretrieval-based and agent-based paradigms, as shown in Figure 2 (a) and (b). Retrieval-based meth-\\nods (Li et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2024b; Dehghan et al., 2024) retrieve relevant facts from KGs\\nwith an external retriever and then feed them into the inputs of LLMs for reasoning. Agent-based\\nmethods (Sun et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2024) treat LLMs as agents that iteratively\\ninteract with KGs to find reasoning paths and answers.\\n∗Equal Contribution.\\n†Corresponding author.\\n1\\narXiv:2410.13080v1  [cs.CL]  16 Oct 2024\\n67.0%\\n18.0%\\n15.0%\\nFaithful Reasoning Path\\nInvalid - Format Error\\nInvalid - Relation Error\\nFigure\\n1:\\nAnalysis\\nof reasoning errors in\\nRoG (Luo et al., 2024).\\nDespite their success, retrieval-based methods require additional accurate\\nretrievers, which may not generalize well to unseen questions or account\\nfor the graph structure (Mavromatis & Karypis, 2024). Conversely, agent-\\nbased methods necessitate multiple rounds of interaction between agents\\nand KGs, leading to high computational costs and latency (Dehghan et al.,\\n2024). Furthermore, existing works still suffer from serious hallucination\\nissues (Agrawal et al., 2024). Sui et al. (2024) indicates that RoG (Luo\\net al., 2024), a leading KG-enhanced reasoning method, still experiences\\n33% hallucination errors during reasoning on KGs, as shown in Figure 1.\\nTo this end, we introduce graph-constrained reasoning (GCR), a novel KG-\\nguided reasoning paradigm that connects unstructured reasoning in LLMs\\nwith structured knowledge in KGs, seeking to eliminate hallucinations dur-\\ning reasoning on KGs and ensure faithful reasoning. Inspired by the con-\\ncept that LLMs reason through decoding (Wei et al., 2022), we incorporate\\nthe KG structure into the LLM decoding process. This enables LLMs to directly reason on graphs\\nby generating reliable reasoning paths grounded in KGs that lead to correct answers.\\nIn GCR, we first convert KG into a structured index, KG-Trie, to facilitate efficient reasoning on KG\\nusing LLM. Trie is also known as the prefix tree (Wikipedia contributors, 2024) that compresses a\\nset of strings, which can be used to restrict LLM output tokens to those starting with valid prefixes\\n(De Cao et al., 2022; Xie et al., 2022). KG-Trie encodes the reasoning paths in KGs as formatted\\nstrings to constrain the decoding process of LLMs. Then, we propose graph-constrained decoding\\nthat employs a lightweight KG-specialized LLM to generate multiple KG-grounded reasoning paths\\nand hypothesis answers. With the constraints from KG-Trie, we ensure faithful reasoning while\\nleveraging the strong reasoning capabilities of LLMs to efficiently explore paths on KGs in constant\\ntime. Finally, we input multiple generated reasoning paths and hypothesis answers into a powerful\\ngeneral LLM to utilize its inductive reasoning ability to produce final answers. In this way, GCR\\ncombines the graph reasoning strength of KG-specialized LLMs and the inductive reasoning advan-\\ntage in general LLMs to achieve faithful and accurate reasoning on KGs. The main contributions of\\nthis work are as follows:\\n• We propose a novel framework called graph-constrained reasoning (GCR) that bridges the\\ngap between structured knowledge in KGs and unstructured reasoning in LLMs, allowing\\nfor efficient reasoning on KGs via LLM decoding.\\n• We combine the complementary strengths of a lightweight KG-specialized LLM with a\\npowerful general LLM to enhance reasoning performance by leveraging their respective\\ngraph-based reasoning and inductive reasoning capabilities.\\n• We conduct extensive experiments on several KGQA reasoning benchmarks, demonstrat-\\ning that GCR not only achieves state-of-the-art performance with zero hallucination, but\\nalso shows zero-shot generalizability for reasoning on unseen KGs without additional train-\\ning.\\n2\\nRELATED WORK\\nLLM reasoning. Many studies have been proposed to analyze and improve the reasoning ability\\nof LLMs (Wei et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2024; Yao et al., 2024). To elicit the reasoning ability\\nof LLMs, Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2022) prompts the model to generate a\\nchain of reasoning steps in response to a question. Wang et al. (2024) propose a self-consistency\\nmechanism that generates multiple reasoning paths and selects the most consistent answer across\\nthem. The tree-of-thought (Yao et al., 2024) structures reasoning as a branching process, exploring\\nmultiple steps in a tree-like structure to find optimal solutions. Other studies focus on fine-tuning\\nLLMs on various reasoning tasks to improve reasoning abilities (Yu et al., 2022; Hoffman et al.,\\n2024). For instance, OpenAI (2024c) adopts reinforcement learning to train their most advanced\\nLLMs called “OpenAI o1” to perform complex reasoning, which produces a long internal chain of\\nthought before final answers.\\nKG-enhanced LLM reasoning. To mitigate the knowledge gap and hallucination issues in LLM\\nreasoning, research incorporates KGs to enhance LLM reasoning (Pan et al., 2024).

To capture graph structure, GNN-\\nRAG (Mavromatis & Karypis, 2024) adopts a lightweight graph neural network to effectively re-\\ntrieve from KGs. Instead of retrieving, StructGPT (Jiang et al., 2023) and ToG (Sun et al., 2024)\\ntreat LLMs as agents to interact with KGs to find reasoning paths leading to the correct answers.\\n3\\nPRELIMINARY\\nKnowledge Graphs (KGs) represent a wealth of factual knowledge as a collection of triples: G =\\n{(e, r, e′) ∈E × R × E}, where E and R denote the set of entities and relations, respectively.\\nReasoning Paths are sequences of consecutive triples in KGs: wz = e0\\nr1\\n−→e1\\nr2\\n−→. . .\\nrl\\n−→el,\\nwhere ∀(ei−1, ri, ei) ∈G. The paths reveal the connections between knowledge that potentially\\nfacilitate reasoning. For example, the reasoning path: wz = Alice\\nmarry to\\n−−−−−−→Bob\\nfather of\\n−−−−−−→\\nCharlie indicates that “Alice” is married to “Bob” and “Bob” is the father of “Charlie”. Therefore,\\n“Alice” could be reasoned to be the mother of “Charlie”.\\nKnowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) is a representative reasoning task with the as-\\nsistance of KGs. Given a natural language question q and a KG G, the task aims to design a function\\nf to reason answers a ∈A based on knowledge from G, i.e., a = f(q, G).\\n3\\n4\\nAPPROACH\\n4.1\\nFROM CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT REASONING TO GRAPH-CONSTRAINED REASONING\\nChain-of-Thought Reasoning (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022) has been widely adopted to enhance the\\nreasoning ability of LLMs by autoregressively generating a series of reasoning steps leading to the\\nanswer. Specifically, given a question q, CoT models the joint probability of the answer a and\\nreasoning steps z as\\nP(a|q) =\\nX\\nz\\nPθ(a|z, q)Pθ(z|q) =\\nX\\nz\\nPθ(a|q, z)\\n|z|\\nY\\ni=1\\nPθ(zi|q, z1:i−1),\\n(1)\\nwhere q denotes the input question, a denotes the final answer, θ denotes the parameters of LLMs,\\nand zi denotes the i-th step of the reasoning process z. To further enhance the reasoning ability,\\nmany previous works focus on improving the reasoning process Pθ(z|q) by exploring and aggregat-\\ning multiple reasoning processes (Wang et al., 2024; Yao et al., 2024).\\nDespite the effectiveness, a major issue remains the faithfulness of the reasoning process generated\\nby LLMs (Huang et al., 2024). The reasoning is represented as a sequence of tokens decoded\\nstep-by-step, which can accumulate errors and result in hallucinated reasoning paths and answers\\n(Nguyen et al., 2024). To address these issues, we utilize knowledge graphs (KGs) to guide LLMs\\ntoward faithful reasoning.\\nKG-enhanced Reasoning utilizes the structured knowledge in KGs to improve the reasoning of\\nLLMs (Luo et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2024), which can generally be expressed as finding a reasoning\\npath wz on KGs that connects the entities mentioned in the question and the answer. This can be\\nformulated as\\nP(a|q, G) =\\nX\\nwz\\nPϕ(a|q, wz)Pϕ(wz|q, G),\\n(2)\\nwhere Pϕ(wz|q, G) denotes the probability of discovering a reasoning path wz on KGs G given the\\nquestion q by a function parameterized by ϕ. To acquire reasoning paths for reasoning, most prior\\nstudies follow the retrieval-based (Li et al., 2023) or agent-based paradigm (Sun et al., 2024), as\\nshown in Figure 2 (a) and (b), respectively. Nevertheless, retrieval-based methods rely on precise\\nadditional retrievers, while agent-based methods are computationally intensive and lead to high\\nlatency. To address these issues, we propose a novel graph-constrained reasoning paradigm (GCR).\\nGraph-constrained Reasoning (GCR) directly incorporates KGs into the decoding process of\\nLLMs to achieve faithful reasoning. The overall framework of GCR is illustrated in Figure 2 (c),\\nwhich consists of three main components: 1) Knowledge Graph Trie Construction: building a\\nstructural index of KG to guide LLM reasoning, 2) Graph-constrained Decoding: generating KG-\\ngrounded paths and hypothesis answers using LLMs, and 3) Graph Inductive Reasoning: reasoning\\nover multiple paths and hypotheses to derive final answers.\\n4.2\\nKNOWLEDGE GRAPH TRIE CONSTRUCTION\\nKnowledge graphs (KGs) store abundant knowledge in a structured format. However, large language\\nmodels (LLMs) struggle to efficiently access and reason on KGs due to their unstructured nature. To\\naddress this issue, we propose to convert KGs into knowledge graph Tries (KG-Tries), which serve\\nas a structured index of KGs to facilitate efficient reasoning on graphs using LLMs.\\nA Trie (a.k.a. prefix tree) (Wikipedia contributors, 2024; Fredkin, 1960) is a tree-like data structure\\nthat stores a dynamic set of strings, where each node represents a common prefix of its children.\\nTries can be used to restrict LLM output tokens to those starting with valid prefixes (De Cao et al.,\\n2022; Xie et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2022). The tree structure of Trie is an ideal choice for encoding\\nthe reasoning paths in KGs for LLMs to efficiently traverse.\\nWe first adopt the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to retrieve reasoning paths Wz within L hops\\nstarting from entities mentioned in the questions. The retrieved paths are formatted as sentences\\nusing the template shown in Figure 7. The formatted sentences are then split into tokens by the\\n4\\ntokenizer of LLM and stored as a KG-Trie CG. The overall process can be formulated as:\\nWz = BFS(G, {eq}, L),\\n(3)\\nTz = Tokenizer(Wz),\\n(4)\\nCG = Trie(Tz),\\n(5)\\nwhere eq denotes the entities mentioned in the question, L denotes the maximum hops of paths, and\\nTz denotes the tokens of reasoning paths. The KG-Trie CG is used as a constraint to guide the LLM\\ndecoding process.\\nBy constructing KG-Trie for each question entity, we can enable efficient traversal of reasoning paths\\nin constant time (O(|Wz|)) without costly graph traversal (Sun et al., 2024). Moreover, KG-Trie can\\nbe pre-constructed offline and loaded during reasoning. This significantly reduces the computational\\ncost and latency of reasoning on KGs, making it feasible for real-time applications.\\n============================= Prompt Input ================================\\nPlease generate some reasoning paths in the KG starting from the topic entities to answer the question.\\n# Question: what is the name of justin bieber brother?\\n============================= LLM Output ================================\\n# Reasoning Path: <PATH> Justin Bieber →people.person.parents →Jeremy Bieber →peo-\\nple.person.children →Jaxon Bieber </PATH>\\n# Answer: Jaxon Bieber\\nFigure 3: An example of the graph-constrained decoding. Detailed prompts can be found in Figure 8.\\n4.3\\nGRAPH-CONSTRAINED DECODING\\nLarge language models (LLMs) have strong reasoning capabilities but still suffer from severe hal-\\nlucination issues, which undermines the trustworthiness of the reasoning process. To tackle this\\nissue, we propose graph-constrained decoding, which unifies the reasoning ability of LLMs with the\\nstructured knowledge in KGs to generate faithful KG-grounded reasoning paths leading to answers.\\nGiven a question q, we design an instruction prompt to harness the reasoning ability of LLMs to\\ngenerate reasoning paths wz and hypothesis answers a. To eliminate the hallucination during rea-\\nsoning on KGs, we adopt the KG-Trie CG as constraints to guide the decoding process of LLMs and\\nonly generate reasoning paths that are valid in KGs, formulated as:\\nPϕ(a, wz|q) = Pϕ(a|q, wz)\\n|\\n{z\\n}\\nRegular decoding\\nGraph-constrained decoding\\nz\\n}|\\n{\\n|wz|\\nY\\ni=1\\nPϕ(wzi|q, wz1:i−1)CG(wzi|wz1:i−1),\\n(6)\\nCG(wzi|wz1:i−1) =\\n\\x1a1, ∃prefix(wz1:i, wz), ∃wz ∈Wz,\\n0, else,\\n(7)\\nwhere wzi denotes the i-th token of the reasoning path wz, Pϕ denotes the token probabilities\\npredicted by the LLM with parameters ϕ, and CG(wzi|wz1:i−1) denotes the constraint function that\\nchecks whether the generated tokens wz1:i is a valid prefix of the reasoning path using KG-Trie.\\nAfter a valid reasoning path is generated, we switch back to the regular decoding process to generate\\na hypothesis answer conditioned on the path.\\nTo further enhance KG reasoning ability, we fine-tune a lightweight KG-specialized LLM with\\nparameters ϕ on the graph-constrained decoding task. Specifically, given a question q, the LLM is\\noptimized to generate relevant reasoning paths wz that are helpful for answering the question, then\\nprovide a hypothesis answer a based on it, which can be formulated as:\\nL = E(q,wz,a)∼DG log Pϕ(a, wz|q) = E\\n\\uf8ee\\n\\uf8f0log\\n|a|\\nY\\ni=1\\nPϕ(ai|q, wz, a1:i−1)\\n|wz|\\nY\\nj=1\\nPϕ(wzj|q, wz1:j−1)\\n\\uf8f9\\n\\uf8fb,\\n(8)\\nwhere ai and wzj denote the i-th token of the answer a and the j-th token of the reasoning path wz,\\nrespectively.\\n5\\nThe training data (q, wz, a) ∈DG consists of question-answer pairs and reasoning paths generated\\nfrom KGs. We use the shortest paths connecting the entities in the question and answer as the\\nreasoning path wz for training, where details can be found in Section 7. An example of graph-\\nconstrained decoding is illustrated in Figure 3, where <PATH> and </PATH> are special tokens\\nto control the start and end of graph-constrained decoding. Experiment results in Section 5.2 show\\nthat even a lightweight KG-specialized LLM (0.5B) can achieve satisfactory performance in KG\\nreasoning.\\nThe graph-constrained decoding method differs from retrieval-based methods by integrating a pre-\\nconstructed KG-Trie into the decoding process of LLMs. This not only reduces input tokens, but\\nalso bridges the gap between unstructured reasoning in LLMs and structured knowledge in KGs,\\nallowing for efficient reasoning on KGs regardless of its scale, which results in faithful reasoning\\nleading to answers. Additionally, experimental results in Section 5.4 demonstrate that KG-Trie can\\nintegrate with new KGs on the fly, showcasing its zero-shot generalizability for reasoning on unseen\\nKGs without further training.\\n4.4\\nGRAPH INDUCTIVE REASONING\\nGraph-constrained decoding harnesses the reasoning ability of a KG-specialized LLM to generate a\\nfaithful reasoning path and a hypothesis answer. However, complex reasoning tasks typically admit\\nmultiple reasoning paths that lead to correct answers (Stanovich et al., 2000). Incorporating diverse\\nreasoning paths would be beneficial for deliberate thinking and reasoning (Evans, 2010; Wang et al.,\\n2024). To this end, we propose to input multiple reasoning paths and hypothesis answers generated\\nby the KG-specialized LLM into a powerful general LLM to leverage its inductive reasoning ability\\nto produce final answers.\\nThe graph-constrained decoding seamlessly integrates into the decoding process of LLMs, allowing\\nit to be paired with various LLM generation strategies like beam-search (Federico et al., 1995) to\\ntake advantage of the GPU parallel computation. Thus, given a question, we adopt graph-constrained\\ndecoding to simultaneously generate K reasoning paths and hypothesis answers with beam search in\\na single LLM call, which are then inputted into a general LLM to derive final answers. The overall\\nprocess can be formulated as:\\nZK = {ak, wk\\nz}K\\nk=1 = arg top-K Pϕ(a, wz|q),\\n(9)\\nPθ(A|q, ZK) ≃\\nK\\nY\\nk=1\\nPθ(A|q, ak, wk\\nz),\\n(10)\\nwhere θ denotes the parameters of the general LLM, ZK denotes the set of top-K reasoning paths\\nand hypothesis answers, and A denotes the final answers.\\nWe follow the FiD framework (Izacard & Grave, 2021; Singh et al., 2021) to incorporate multiple\\nreasoning paths and hypothesis answers to conduct inductive reasoning within one LLM call, i.e.,\\nPθ(A|q, ZK), where detailed prompts can be found in Figure 9. The general LLM can be any\\npowerful LLM, such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022), or Llama-3 (Meta, 2024), which can effectively\\nleverage their internal reasoning ability to reason over multiple reasoning paths to produce final\\nanswers without additional fine-tuning.\\n5\\nEXPERIMENT\\nIn our experiments, we aim to answer the following research questions: RQ1: Can GCR achieve\\nstate-of-the-art reasoning performance with balances between efficiency and effectiveness? RQ2:\\nCan GCR eliminate hallucinations and conduct faithful reasoning? RQ3: Can GCR generalize to\\nunseen KGs on the fly?\\n5.1\\nEXPERIMENT SETUPS\\nDatasets. Following previous research (Luo et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2024), we first evaluate the\\nreasoning ability of GCR on two benchmark KGQA datasets: WebQuestionSP (WebQSP) (Yih et al.,\\n2016) and Complex WebQuestions (CWQ) (Talmor & Berant, 2018).

For CSQA, we use\\nConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017) as the KG, while for MedQA, we use a medical KG constructed\\nfrom the Unified Medical Language System (Yasunaga et al., 2021). The details of the datasets are\\ndescribed in Section 7.\\nBaselines. We compare GCR with the 22 baselines grouped into three categories: 1) LLM reasoning\\nmethods, 2) graph reasoning methods, and 3) KG-enhanced LLM reasoning methods. The detailed\\nbaselines are listed in Section 8.\\nEvaluation Metrics. We adopt Hit and F1 as the evaluation metrics following previous works (Luo\\net al., 2024; Sun et al., 2024) on WebQSP and CWQ.

Because CSQA and MedQA are multiple-choice QA datasets, we adopt\\naccuracy as the evaluation metric.\\nImplementations. For GCR, we use the KG-Trie to index all the reasoning paths within 2 hops\\nstarting from question entities. For the LLMs, we use a fine-tuned Llama-3-8B (Meta, 2024) as\\nthe KG-specialized LLM. We generate top-10 reasoning paths and hypothesis answers from graph-\\nconstrained decoding. We adopt the advanced ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022) and GPT-4o-mini (OpenAI,\\n2024a) as the general LLMs for inductive reasoning. The detailed hyperparameters and experiment\\nsettings are described in Section 9.\\n5.2\\nRQ1: REASONING PERFORMANCE AND EFFICIENCY\\nMain Results.

But they struggle to generalize across different datasets and\\nunderperform on CWQ. In KG+LLM methods, both agent-based methods (e.g., ToG, EffiQA) and\\nretrieval-based methods (e.g., RoG, GNN-RAG) achieve the second-best performance. Neverthe-\\nless, they still suffer from inefficiency and reasoning hallucinations which limit their performance.\\nIn contrast, GCR effectively eliminates hallucinations and conducts faithful reasoning by leveraging\\nthe structured KG index and graph-constrained decoding.\\nEfficiency Analysis.\\nTo show the efficiency of GCR, we compare the average runtime, number of LLM calls, and num-\\nber of input tokens with retrieval-based and agent-based methods in Table 2. For retrieval-based\\nmethods, we compare with dense retrievers (e.g., S-Bert (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019), BGE (Zhang\\net al., 2023), OpenAI-Emb. (OpenAI, 2024b)) and graph-based retrievers (e.g., GNN-RAG (Mavro-\\nmatis & Karypis, 2024), RoG (Luo et al., 2024)), which retrieve reasoning paths from KGs and feed\\nthem into LLMs for reasoning answers. For agent-based methods, we compare with ToG (Sun et al.,\\n2024) and EffiQA1 (Dong et al., 2024), which heuristically search on KGs for answers. The detailed\\nsettings are described in Section 9.\\nDense retrievers are most efficient in terms of runtime and LLM calls as they convert all paths into\\nsentences and encode them as embeddings in advance. However, they sacrifice their accuracy in\\nretrieving as they are not designed to encode graph structure. Graph-based retrievers and agent-\\nbased methods achieve better performance by considering graph structure; however, they require\\nmore time and LLM calls. Specifically, the retrieved graph is fed as inputs to LLMs, which leads to\\na large number of input tokens. Agent-based methods, like ToG, require more LLM calls and input\\ntokens as the question difficulty increases due to their iterative reasoning process. In contrast, GCR\\nachieves the best performance with a reasonable runtime and number of LLM calls. With the help\\nof KG-Trie, GCR explores multiple reasoning paths at the same time during the graph-constrained\\ndecoding, which does not involve additional LLM calls or input tokens and benefits from the parallel\\nGPU computation with low latency. More efficiency analysis under different beam sizes used for\\ngraph-constrained decoding can be found in parameter analysis.\\nTable 3: Ablation studies of GCR on two KGQA datasets.\\nVariants\\nWebQSP\\nCWQ\\nF1\\nPrecision\\nRecall\\nF1\\nPrecision\\nRecall\\nGCR (Llama-3.1-8B + ChatGPT)\\n73.2\\n80.0\\n76.9\\n60.9\\n61.1\\n66.6\\nGCR w/o KG-specialized LLM\\n52.9\\n66.3\\n50.2\\n37.5\\n40.8\\n37.9\\nGCR w/o General LLM\\n57.0\\n58.0\\n70.1\\n39.4\\n32.8\\n64.3\\nAblation Study. We first conduct an\\nablation study to analyze the effec-\\ntiveness of the KG-specialized LLM\\nand general LLM in GCR. As shown\\nin Table 3, the full GCR achieves the\\nbest performance on both datasets.\\nBy removing the KG-specialized LLM, we feed all 2-hop reasoning paths into the general LLM.\\nThis results in a significant performance drop, indicating its importance in utilizing reasoning abil-\\nity to find relevant paths on KGs for reasoning. On the other hand, removing the general LLM\\nand relying solely on answers predicted by KG-specialized LLM leads to a noticeable decrease in\\nprecision, due to noises in its predictions. This highlighting the necessity of the general LLM for\\nconducting inductive reasoning over multiple paths to derive final answers.\\nDifferent LLMs. We further analyze LLMs used for KG-specialized and general LLMs in Table 4.\\nFor KG-specialized LLMs, we directly plug the KG-Trie into different LLMs to conduct graph-\\nconstrained decoding and use the same general LLM for final reasoning. For general LLMs, we\\nadopt the same reasoning paths generated by KG-specialized LLMs to different LLMs to produce\\nfinal answers. For zero-shot and few-shot learning, we adopt the original LLMs without fine-tuning,\\nwhose prompt templates can be found in Figures 8 and 10.\\n1Since there is no available code for EffiQA, we directly copy the results from the original paper.\\n8\\nTable 4: Comparison of different LLMs used in\\nGCR on WebQSP.\\nComponents\\nLearning Types\\nVariants\\nHit\\nF1\\nKG-specialized\\nLLM\\nZero-shot\\nLlama-3.1-8B\\n28.25\\n10.32\\nLlama-3.1-70B\\n38.53\\n12.53\\nFew-shot\\nLlama-3.1-8B\\n33.24\\n11.19\\nLlama-3.1-70B\\n41.13\\n13.14\\nFine-tuned\\nQwen2-0.5B\\n87.48\\n60.03\\nQwen2-1.5B\\n89.21\\n62.97\\nQwen2-7B\\n92.31\\n72.74\\nLlama-2-7B\\n92.55\\n73.23\\nLlama-3.1-8B\\n92.74\\n73.14\\nGeneral LLM\\nZero-shot\\nQwen-2-7B\\n86.32\\n67.59\\nLlama-3.1-8B\\n90.24\\n71.19\\nLlama-3.1-70B\\n90.24\\n71.19\\nChatGPT\\n92.55\\n73.23\\nGPT-4o-mini\\n92.23\\n74.05\\nResults in Table 4 show that a lightweight LLM\\n(0.5B) can outperform a large one (70B) af-\\nter fine-tuning, indicating the effectiveness of\\nfine-tuning in enhancing the ability of LLMs\\nand make them specialized for KG reason-\\ning.\\nHowever, the larger LLMs (e.g., 7B\\nand 8B) still perform better than smaller ones,\\nhighlighting the importance of model capac-\\nity in searching relevant reasoning paths on\\nKGs.\\nSimilar trends are observed in gen-\\neral LLMs where larger models (e.g., GPT-4o-\\nmini and ChatGPT) outperform smaller ones\\n(e.g., Qwen-2-7B and Llama-3.1-8B), show-\\ncasing their stronger inductive reasoning abili-\\nties. This further emphasizes the need of paring\\npowerful general LLMs with lightweight KG-specialized LLMs to achieve better reasoning driven\\nby both of them.\\n1\\n3\\n5\\n10\\n20\\nGraph-constrained decoding beam size K\\n0\\n2\\n4\\n6\\n8\\nGeneration Time (s)\\n40\\n50\\n60\\n70\\n80\\n90\\nAnswer Coverage (%)\\nGeneration Time (s)\\nHit\\nF1\\nPrecision\\nRecall\\nFigure 4: Parameter analysis of beam\\nsize K.\\nParameter Analysis. We first analyze the impact of dif-\\nferent beam sizes K for graph-constrained decoding on\\nthe performance of GCR. We conduct the experiments on\\nWebQSP with different beam sizes of 1, 3, 5, 10, and 20.\\nThe results are shown in Figure 4. We observe that the hit\\nand recall of GCR increase with the beam size. Because,\\nwith a larger beam size, the LLMs can explore more rea-\\nsoning paths and find the correct answers. However, the\\nF1 score, peaks when the beam size is set to 10. This is\\nbecause the beam size of 10 can provide a balance be-\\ntween the exploration and exploitation of the reasoning\\npaths. When the beam size is set to 20, the performance\\ndrops due to the increased complexity of the search space,\\nwhich may introduce noise and make the reasoning less\\nreliable. This also highlights the importance of using general LLMs to conduct inductive reason-\\ning over multiple paths to disregard the noise and find the correct answers. Although the graph-\\nconstrained decoding benefits from the parallel GPU computation to explore multiple reasoning\\npaths at the same time, the time cost still slightly increases from 1.4s to 7.8s with the increase of\\nthe beam size. Thus, we set the beam size to 10 in the experiments to balance the performance and\\nefficiency. We also investigate the impact of L hops paths used for KG-Trie construction in Sec-\\ntion 10.1. The results show that GCR can achieve a good balance between reasoning performance\\nand efficiency by setting L = 2 and K = 10.\\n5.3\\nRQ2: HALLUCINATION ELIMINATION AND FAITHFUL REASONING\\nIn this section, we investigate the effectiveness of KG constraints in eliminating hallucinations and\\nensuring faithful reasoning. We first compare the difference of answer accuracy (Hit) and faithful\\nreasoning ratio by removing KG constraints in graph-constrained decoding. The faithful reasoning\\nratio is calculated as the percentage of faithful reasoning in correctly predicted answers. We define\\na reasoning as faithful where the generated reasoning path can be found in KGs, and vice versa.\\nGCR GCR w/o constraint\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\nAnswer Hit\\n100.0%\\n62.4%\\nWebQSP\\nFaithful Reasoning\\nError Reasoning\\nGCR GCR w/o constraint\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\nAnswer Hit\\n100.0%\\n48.1%\\nCWQ\\nFigure 5: Analysis of performance and reasoning\\nerrors in GCR.\\nFrom the Figure 5, we can observe that GCR\\nachieves the 100% faithful reasoning ratio on\\nboth datasets, which indicates that GCR can\\neliminate hallucinations and ensure faithful rea-\\nsoning during reasoning on KGs. In contrast,\\nwhen removing KG constraints, both the an-\\nswer accuracy and faithful reasoning decrease\\nsignificantly on WebQSP. This shows that KG\\nconstraints not only improve reasoning by re-\\nducing the searching space, but also play a cru-\\ncial role in preventing hallucinations for accu-\\n9\\nTable 5: Examples of the faithful reasoning conducted by GCR. Red denotes the incorrect reasoning\\npaths and answers, while bold denotes the correct paths and answers.\\nCase 1: Incorrect answers and hallucinated reasoning paths without constraints.\\nQuestion\\nWho is niall ferguson ’s wife?\\nAnswer\\nAyaan Hirsi Ali\\nGCR w/o constraint\\n# Reasoning Path: Niall Ferguson →people.person.children →Mabel Rose Ferguson →\\npeople.person.parents →Alyssa Mastromonaco\\n#Answer: Alyssa Mastromonaco\\nGCR\\n# Reasoning Path: Niall Ferguson →people.person.children →Thomas Ferguson →peo-\\nple.person.parents →Ayaan Hirsi Ali\\n#Answer: Ayaan Hirsi Ali\\nCase 2: Correct answers but hallucinated reasoning paths without constraints.\\nQuestion\\nWhere is jamarcus russell from?\\nAnswer\\nMobile\\nGCR w/o constraint\\n# Reasoning Path: JaMarcus Russell →people.person.place of birth →Tampa\\n#Answer: Mobile, Alabama\\nGCR\\n# Reasoning Path: JaMarcus Russell →people.person.place of birth →Mobile\\n#Answer: Mobile\\nrate reasoning. While the answer hit rate on CWQ remains almost unchanged, the ratio of faithful\\nreasoning still decreases to 48.1%. This implies that even if LLMs can produce correct answers, the\\nreasoning process is still prone to hallucinations and cannot be trusted, which is aligned with the\\nfindings in previous studies (Nguyen et al., 2024).\\nCase Study. We further provide a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of GCR in eliminating\\nhallucinations and ensuring faithful reasoning. As shown in Table 5, the first case demonstrates that,\\nwithout constraints, the model generates an incorrect reasoning path leading to an incorrect answer\\nby hallucinating facts such as “Mabel Rose Ferguson is the child of Naill Ferguson and her parent\\nis Alyssa Mastromonaco”. In contrast, GCR generates a faithful reasoning path grounded in KGs\\nthat “Naill Ferguson has a child named Thomas Ferguson who has a parent named Ayaan Hirsi Ali”.\\nBased on the paths we can reason the correct answer to the question is “Ayaan Hirsi Ali”. In the\\nsecond case, although the LLM answers the question correctly, the generated reasoning path is still\\nhallucinated with incorrect facts. Conversely, GCR conducts faithful reasoning with both correct\\nanswer and reasoning path. These results demonstrate that GCR can effectively eliminate hallucina-\\ntions and ensure faithful reasoning by leveraging KG constraints in graph-constrained decoding.\\n5.4\\nRQ3: ZERO-SHOT GENERALIZABILITY TO UNSEEN KGS\\nTable 6: Zero-shot transferabil-\\nity to other KGQA datasets.\\nModel\\nCSQA\\nMedQA\\nChatGPT\\n79\\n64\\nGCR (ChatGPT)\\n85\\n66\\nGPT-4o-mini\\n91\\n75\\nGCR (GPT-4o-mini)\\n94\\n79\\nIn GCR, the knowledge graph is converted into a constraint which\\nis plugged into the decoding process of LLMs. This allows GCR\\nto generalize to unseen KGs without further training. To evaluate\\nthe generalizability of GCR, we conduct zero-shot transfer ex-\\nperiments on two unseen KGQA datasets: CSQA (Talmor et al.,\\n2019) and MedQA (Jin et al., 2021). Specifically, we use the\\nsame KG-specialized LLM (Llama-3.1-8B) trained on Freebase\\nas well as two general LLMs (ChatGP, GPT-4o-mini). During\\nreasoning, we directly plug the KG-Trie constructed from ConceptNet and medical KGs into the\\nGCR to conduct graph-constrained decoding without additional fine-tuning. The results are shown\\nin Table 6.\\nFrom the results, it is evident that GCR outperforms ChatGPT and GPT-4o-mini in zero-shot per-\\nformance on both datasets. Specifically, GCR shows a 7.6% increase in accuracy on CSQA and a\\n3.1% improvement on MedQA compared to ChatGPT. This highlights the strong zero-shot general-\\nizability of its graph reasoning capabilities to unseen KGs without additional training. However, the\\nimprovement on MedQA is not as significant as that on CSQA. We hypothesize this difference may\\nbe due to LLMs having more common sense knowledge, which aids in reasoning on common sense\\nknowledge graphs effectively. On the other hand, medical KGs are more specialized and require\\ndomain-specific knowledge for reasoning, potentially limiting the generalizability of our method.\\n10\\n6\\nCONCLUSION\\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel LLM reasoning paradigm called graph-constrained reasoning\\n(GCR) to eliminate hallucination and ensure faithful reasoning by incorporating structured KGs. To\\nbridge the unstructured reasoning in LLMs with the structured knowledge in KGs, we propose a\\nKG-Trie to encode paths in KGs using a trie-based index. KG-Trie constrains the decoding process\\nto guide a KG-specialized LLM to generate faithful reasoning paths grounded in KGs. By impos-\\ning constraints, we can not only eliminate hallucination in reasoning but also reduce the reasoning\\ncomplexity, contributing to more efficient and accurate reasoning. Last, a powerful general LLM is\\nutilized as a complement to inductively reason over multiple reasoning paths to generate the final\\nanswer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GCR excels in faithful reasoning and generalizes\\nwell to reason on new KGs without additional fine-tuning.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nWe would want to express our sincere gratitude to Yuan-Fang Li for his valuable feedback and\\nsuggestions during the preparation of this work.\\nREFERENCES\\nGarima Agrawal, Tharindu Kumarage, Zeyad Alghamdi, and Huan Liu.

To compare the reasoning performance with existing methods, we use two bench-\\nmark KGQA datasets in this study: WebQuestionSP (WebQSP) (Yih et al., 2016) and Complex We-\\nbQuestions (CWQ) (Talmor & Berant, 2018). To ensure fairness, we adopt the same train and test\\nsplits as previous works (Jiang et al., 2022; Luo et al., 2024). Details of the datasets can be found in\\nTable 7.\\nBoth WebQSP and CWQ can be reasoned using Freebase KGs2 (Bollacker et al., 2008). To reduce\\nthe size of the KGs, we use a subgraph of Freebase by extracting all triples that start from question\\nentities within the maximum reasoning hops provided by previous works3 (Luo et al., 2024). The\\nstatistics of the knowledge graphs are shown in Table 9.\\nFine-tuning Datasets. To enhance the KG reasoning ability of LLMs, we construct fine-tuning\\ndatasets by generating reasoning paths from the KGs. Specifically, we adopt the training split of\\nWebQSP and CWQ, which contain 2,826 and 27,639 question-answer pairs, respectively. For each\\nquestion, we find all the shortest reasoning paths on KGs that connect the question entity to the\\nanswer entity. We then convert the reasoning paths into formatted strings and pair them with the\\nquestion-answer pairs with the template shown in Figure 8 to form the fine-tuning datasets. Since\\nthere could be multiple reasoning paths for a question, we generate multiple training instances paired\\nwith different reasoning paths for each question-answer pair. The fine-tuning datasets contain 28,307\\nand 181,602 question-reasoning path-answer triples for WebQSP and CWQ, respectively. The statis-\\ntics of the fine-tuning datasets are shown in Table 8.\\nZero-shot Generalization Datasets.\\nTo evaluate the transferability of GCR, we further select\\ntwo new KGQA datasets4: CommonsenseQA (CSQA) (Talmor et al., 2019) and MedQA-USMLE\\n(MedQA) (Jin et al., 2021). CSQA is a 5-way multiple choice QA dataset that involves reasoning\\nwith commonsense knowledge. MedQA is a 4-way multiple choice QA task that requires biomed-\\nical and clinical knowledge. For CSQA, we use the ConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017), which is a\\ngeneral-purpose KG that contains commonsense knowledge. For MedQA, we use a medical KG\\n2https://github.com/microsoft/FastRDFStore\\n3WebQSP: https://huggingface.co/datasets/rmanluo/RoG-webqsp, CWQ: https://\\nhuggingface.co/datasets/rmanluo/RoG-cwq\\n4https://github.com/michiyasunaga/qagnn\\n15\\nconstructed from the Unified Medical Language System (Yasunaga et al., 2021). The statistics of\\nthe knowledge graphs are shown in Table 9. We respectively select 100 questions from each dataset.\\nFor each question, following previous studies (Feng et al., 2020; Yasunaga et al., 2021), a 2-hop\\nsubgraph is extracted from the KGs to form the zero-shot generalization datasets.\\nTable 7: Statistics of datasets.\\nDataset\\nDataset Statistics\\nStatistics of Answer Numbers\\n#Train\\n#Test\\n#Ans = 1\\n2 ≥#Ans ≤4\\n5 ≥#Ans ≤9\\n#Ans ≥10\\nWebQSP\\n2,826\\n1,628\\n51.2%\\n27.4%\\n8.3%\\n12.1%\\nCWQ\\n27,639\\n3,531\\n70.6%\\n19.4%\\n6%\\n4%\\nTable 8: Statistics of fine-tuning datasets for graph-constrained decoding.\\nTotal\\nWebQSP\\nCWQ\\n209,909\\n28,307\\n181,602\\nTable 9: Statistics of constructed knowledge graphs.\\nKG\\n#Entities\\n#Relations\\n#Triples\\nFreebase\\n2,566,291\\n7,058\\n8,309,195\\nConceptNet\\n799,273\\n17\\n2,151,303\\nMedKG\\n9,958\\n15\\n49,974\\n8\\nBASELINES\\nWe compare GCR with the 22 baselines grouped into three categories: 1) LLM reasoning methods,\\n2) graph reasoning methods, and 3) KG-enhanced LLM reasoning methods. The details of each\\nbaseline are described as follows.\\nLLM reasoning methods only rely on LLMs for reasoning without utilizing external KGs. We\\ninclude both the vanilla LLMs with different sizes and the LLMs with advanced reasoning mecha-\\nnisms. Specifically, we consider the following baselines:\\n• Qwen2-0.5B/1.5B.7B (Yang et al., 2024a) provides a series of pre-trained LLMs with dif-\\nferent sizes, including 0.5B, 1.5B, and 7B parameters.\\n• Llama-2-7B (Touvron et al., 2023) is a large-scale LLM pre-trained on a diverse range of\\ntasks.\\n• Llama-3.1-8B (Meta, 2024) is the updated version of Llama-2 with more powerful reason-\\ning capabilities.\\n• ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022) is a powerful closed-source LLM that could follow instructions\\nto conduct complex tasks.\\n• GPT-4o-mini (OpenAI, 2024a) is the new flagship model of OpenAI that could reason\\nacross different modalities and tasks.\\n• Few-shot prompt (Brown et al., 2020) is a few-shot learning method that provides LLMs\\nwith a few examples in the prompts to conduct reasoning.\\n• CoT (Wei et al., 2022) is a chain-of-thought reasoning method that prompts LLMs to gen-\\nerate a chain of reasoning steps.\\n• Self-consistency (Wang et al., 2024) generates multiple reasoning paths and selects the\\nmost consistent answer.\\n16\\nGraph reasoning methods focus on reasoning on KGs using graph neural networks (GNNs) (Wu\\net al., 2020) or graph-based reasoning mechanisms. We include the following baselines:\\n• GraftNet (Sun et al., 2018) is a graph-based reasoning method that retrieves relevant sub-\\ngraphs from KGs with entity linking.\\n• NSM (He et al., 2021) utilizes the sequential model to mimic the multi-hop reasoning\\nprocess on KGs.\\n• SR+NSM (Zhang et al., 2022) proposes a relation-path retrieval to retrieve subgraphs for\\nmulti-hop reasoning.\\n• ReaRev (Mavromatis & Karypis, 2022) is a GNN-based method that reasons on KGs by\\nconsidering complex graph information.\\nKG-enhanced LLM reasoning methods incorporate KGs to enhance the reasoning abilities of\\nLLMs which can be further divided into retrieval-based and agent-based paradigms. We include the\\nfollowing baselines:\\nRetrieval-based methods retrieve relevant facts from KGs with an external retriever and then feed\\nthem into the inputs of LLMs for reasoning:\\n• KD-CoT (Wang et al., 2023) retrieves relevant knowledge from KGs to generate faithful\\nreasoning plans for LLMs.\\n• EWEK-QA (Dehghan et al., 2024) enriches the retrieved knowledge by searching from\\nboth KGs and web.\\n• RoG (Luo et al., 2024) proposes a planning-retrieval-reasoning framework that retrieves\\nreasoning paths from KGs to guide LLMs conducting faithful reasoning.\\n• GNN-RAG (Mavromatis & Karypis, 2024) adopts a lightweight graph neural network to\\neffectively retrieve from KGs.\\n• GNN-RAG+RA (Mavromatis & Karypis, 2024) combines the retrieval results of both RoG\\nand GNN-RAG to enhance the reasoning performance.\\nAgent-based methods treat LLMs as agents that iteratively interact with KGs to find reasoning paths\\nand answers:\\n• ToG (Sun et al., 2024) conducts the reasoning on KGs by exploring multiple paths and\\nconcludes the final answer by aggregating the evidence from them.\\n• EffiQA (Jiang et al., 2024) proposes an efficient agent-based method to reason on KGs.\\n9\\nIMPLEMENTATION DETAILS AND EXPERIMENT SETTINGS\\nIn this section, we will detail the implementation of GCR as well as the experiment settings.\\nFine-tuning KG-specialized LLMs. We fine-tune several lightweight LLMs ranging from 0.5B to\\n8B (Yang et al., 2024a; Touvron et al., 2023; Meta, 2024) on the fine-tuning datasets for 3 epochs.\\nThe batch size is set to 4 and the learning rate is set to 2e-5. We use the cosine learning rate scheduler\\npolicy with the warmup ratio set to 0.03. The training is conducted on 2 A100-80G GPUs for each\\nmodel. The training time and memory usage are shown in Table 10.\\nKGQA Experiment Settings. The KGQA experiment shown in Table 1 aims to compare the rea-\\nsoning performance of GCR with existing methods. For our method, we use the fine-tuned Llama-\\n3.1-8B as KG-specialized LLMs, the general LLM is selected as ChatGPT and GPT-4o-mini. The\\nKG-Trie is constructed from the subgraph of Freebase KGs. The maximum reasoning hops are set\\nto 2 for both WebQSP and CWQ. The beam size is set to 10 for graph-constrained decoding. For\\nvanilla LLMs baselines, we use the zero-shot prompting to ask the models to answer the questions.\\nFor other baselines, we strictly check whether the original papers follow the same settings and copy\\nthe results for fair comparison.\\nEfficiency Analysis Settings. The efficiency analysis shown in Table 2 aims to compare the effi-\\nciency and performance of different methods on WebQSP. For GCR, we use the same settings as the\\n17\\nTable 10: Training time and memory usage for different KG-specialized LLMs.\\nModel\\nTime\\nMem. Usage per GPU\\nQwen2-0.5B\\n3.47h\\n10G\\nQwen2-1.5B\\n4.11h\\n25G\\nQwen2-7B\\n14.37h\\n81G\\nLlama-2-7B\\n13.93h\\n80G\\nLlama-3.1-8B\\n14.52h\\n85G\\nKGQA experiment. For dense retriever methods (e.g., S-Bert (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019), BGE\\n(Zhang et al., 2023), OpenAI-Emb. (OpenAI, 2024b)), we first search all paths within 2-hops on the\\nKGs which are formatted as sentences with the template in Figure 7. Then, we adopt the embedding\\nmodel to encode the path sentences as embeddings which are stored in a vector database. During in-\\nference, we retrieve 10 paths from the vector database with the question as query and feed them into\\nthe LLMs for reasoning. For GNN-RAG (Mavromatis & Karypis, 2024) and RoG (Luo et al., 2024),\\nwe strictly follow the original papers to retrieve reasoning paths and conduct the experiments. For\\nagent-based methods (e.g., ToG (Sun et al., 2024)), we use the same settings detailed in the original\\npapers. For EffiQA (Jiang et al., 2024), since there is no available code, we directly copy the results\\nfrom the original paper.\\nThe average runtime is measured by the time taken to answer the questions. The average number\\nof LLM calls is the number of times the LLMs are called to answer the questions. The average\\nnumber of LLM tokens is the number of tokens inputted into LLMs to answer the questions, such\\nas questions and retrieved reasoning paths. The experiments are conducted on a single A100-80G\\nGPU for each method.\\nAblation Study. In ablation study, we first try to analyze the effectiveness of different components in\\nGCR. We conduct the experiments on WebQSP and CWQ datasets. By removing the KG-specialized\\nLLM (w/o KG-specialized LLM), we search all the 2-hop paths starting from question entities and\\nfeed them into the general LLMs for reasoning. By removing the general LLM (w/o general LLM),\\nwe directly use the hypothesis answers generated by the KG-specialized LLMs as the final answers.\\nDifferent LLMs. We also analyze the different LLMs used for KG-specialized LLMs and general\\nLLMs on WebQSP. For KG-specialized LLMs, we first use the vanilla LLMs with different learning\\ntypes (i.e., zero-shot and few-shot prompting). For zero-shot prompting, we directly ask the models\\nto generate the reasoning paths with the constraints. For few-shot prompting, we provide the models\\nwith a few examples in the prompts to conduct path generation. Detailed prompts can be found in\\nFigures 8 and 10. Then, we fine-tune the lightweight LLMs with different sizes (0.5B to 8B) on the\\ngraph-constrained decoding task. For general LLMs, we use the vanilla LLMs to directly conduct\\nreasoning over multiple reasoning paths. The detailed reasoning prompts can be found in Figure 9.\\nParameter Analysis. We first analyze the performance of GCR with different beam sizes for graph-\\nconstrained decoding. We conduct the experiments on the WebQSP datasets with beam sizes of 1, 3,\\n5, 10, and 20. Then, we analyze the performance of GCR with different hops of paths encoded in the\\nKG-Trie. We conduct the experiments on the WebQSP datasets with maximum paths hops ranging\\nfrom 1 to 4.\\nFaithful Reasoning Analysis. We investigate the effect of the KG constraints on ensuring faithful\\nreasoning. We adopt the fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B as KG-specialized LLMs. Then, we compare\\nthe faithful reasoning rate and answer hit of GCR with and without the KG constraints in graph-\\nconstrained decoding. The faithful reasoning rate is the percentage of the faithful reasoning in the\\ncorrectly predicted answers. A reasoning path is considered faithful if it can be found in the KGs,\\nand vice versa. The answer hit is the percentage of the correct answers in the predictions.\\nZero-shot Generalization Analysis. We evaluate the transferability of GCR on two zero-shot gen-\\neralization datasets: CSQA and MedQA. We use the fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B as KG-specialized\\nLLMs and ChatGPT as well as GPT-4o-mini as the general LLMs. The KG-Trie is constructed\\nfrom the subgraph of ConceptNet and MedKG. The maximum reasoning hops are set to 2 for both\\ndatasets. The beam size is set to 10 for graph-constrained decoding. For vanilla LLMs baselines\\n18\\n(i.e., ChatGPT and GPT-4o-mini), we use the zero-shot prompting to ask the models to answer the\\nquestions.\\n10\\nADDITIONAL EXPERIMENT RESULTS\\n10.1\\nPERFORMANCE ON DIFFERENT HOPS\\nIn this section, we analyze the impact of different hops of reasoning paths on the performance of\\nGCR. We conduct the experiments on WebQSP with different maximum hops of reasoning paths\\nencoded in the KG-Trie. The results are shown in Figure 6. We observe that the performance\\nof GCR increases with the number of hops of reasoning paths. The performance peaks when the\\nmaximum hops of reasoning paths are set to 2. This is because the 2-hop paths can provide sufficient\\ninformation for the LLMs to conduct reasoning. When the hops are set to 3 or 4, the performance\\ndrops due to the increased complexity of the reasoning paths, which may introduce noise and make\\nthe reasoning less reliable. Additionally, the size of the KG-Trie slightly increases from 0.5 MB to\\n7.5 MB with the increase of the hops from 1 to 4. This indicates that the KG-Trie can be efficiently\\nconstructed with a small size and guide the LLMs to reason on graphs effectively.\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\nKG-Trie Path Length L\\n0\\n2\\n4\\n6\\nAvg.

The template for converting reasoning paths into natural language sen-\\ntences is shown in Figure 7, where the e∗and r∗denotes the entities and relations in a reasoning\\npath wz = e0\\nr1\\n−→e1\\nr2\\n−→. . .\\nrl\\n−→el,\\nPath Sentence Template\\n<PATH> e1 →r1 →e2 →. . . →rl →el </PATH>\\nFigure 7: The template for converting reasoning paths into formatted sentences.\\nGraph-constrained Decoding Prompt. The prompt for graph-constrained decoding is shown in\\nFigure 8, where the question and mentioned entities are provided to the LLMs to generate rea-\\nsoning paths and hypothesis answers. In the fine-tuning datasets, the supervised LLM outputs are\\nconstructed from the ground-truth answers and reasoning paths extracted from the KGs.\\n19\\nGraph-constrained Decoding Prompt\\n============================= Prompt Input ================================\\nReasoning path is a sequence of triples in the KG that connects the topic entities in the question to\\nanswer entities. Given a question, please generate some reasoning paths in the KG starting from the\\ntopic entities to answer the question.\\n# Question:\\n<Question>\\n# Topic entities:\\n<Question Entities>\\n============================= LLM Output ================================\\n# Reasoning Path:\\n<PATH> <Reasoning Path> </PATH>\\n# Answer:\\n<Hypothesis Answer>\\nFigure 8: The prompt template for graph-constrained decoding.\\nThe few-shot prompt template for graph-constrained decoding is shown in Figure 10. We provide a\\nfew examples in the prompts to guide the LLMs to generate reasoning paths. Since the LLMs with\\nfew-shot prompt learning are not fine-tuned on the graph-constrained decoding task, we only apply\\nthe constraint to generate reasoning paths.\\nGraph Inductive Reasoning Prompt. The prompt for graph inductive reasoning is shown in Fig-\\nure 9. We adopt the graph-constrained decoding to generate K reasoning paths and hypothesis\\nanswers for each question. The reasoning paths and hypothesis answers are provided to the general\\nLLMs to answer the questions without fine-tuning.\\nGraph Inductive Reasoning Prompt\\n============================= Prompt Input ================================\\n# Reasoning Paths:\\n<Reasoning Path 1><Hypothesis Answer 1>\\n. . .\\n<Reasoning Path K><Hypothesis Answer K>\\n# Question:\\n<Question>\\nBased on the reasoning paths, please answer the given question.

Gradually expanding rule of the British East India Company followed, turning India into a colonial economy but also consolidating its sovereignty. British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly, but technological changes were introduced, and modern ideas of education and public life took root. A pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged, which was noted for nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in ending British rule. In 1947, the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions, a Hindu-majority dominion of India and a Muslim-majority dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration.\\nIndia has been a federal republic since 1950, governed through a democratic parliamentary system, and has been the world's most populous democracy since the time of its independence in 1947. It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually in 1951 to US$2,601 in 2022, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. During the same time, its population grew from 361 million to almost 1.4 billion, and India became the most populous country in 2023. From being a comparatively destitute country in 1951, India has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for information technology services, with an expanding middle class. India has a space programme with several planned or completed extraterrestrial missions. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture. India has substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality. India is a nuclear-weapon state, which ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century. Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition, and rising levels of air pollution. India's land is megadiverse, with four biodiversity hotspots. Its forest cover comprises 21.7% of its area. India's wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in India's culture, is supported among these forests, and elsewhere, in protected habitats.\", 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India'}, page_content=\"India, officially the Republic of India, is a country in South Asia.

      "The Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, commonly known by its backronym I.N.D.I.A. is an opposition front announced by the leaders of 28 parties to contest the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The name was proposed during a meeting in Bengaluru and was unanimously adopted by the 28 participating parties. While some sources attribute the suggestion of the name to Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the Indian National Congress (INC), others mention that it was suggested by Mamata Banerjee, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo and chief minister of West Bengal.\n",

      "On September 25, 2022, Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) supremo Om Prakash Chautala hosted a rally in Fatehabad on the occasion of Former Deputy Prime Minister Devi Lal's birth anniversary. During this rally, the ideas of a national alliance were first openly called on stage. Chief Minister of Bihar Nitish Kumar had said \"I'll urge all parties, including Congress, to get together and then they (BJP) will lost badly\". JD(U) spokesperson K. C. Tyagi had also stated that the foundation of the alliance was during this same rally.\n",
      "The first major Opposition parties' meeting, held in Patna, Bihar, was chaired by Nitish Kumar on 23 June 2023, when the proposal for a new alliance was put on the table. The meeting was attended by 16 Opposition parties. INLD was not included in this meeting.\n",
      "The second meeting, was held in Bengaluru, Karnataka on 17–18 July. It was chaired by UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi when the proposal for an alliance was accepted and ten more parties were added to the list. The alliance's name was finalized and given the name Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance.\n",
      "The third meeting was held in Mumbai, Maharashtra from 31 August to 1 September. The meeting was hosted by Shiv Sena (UBT) President Uddhav Thackeray and saw Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and chief ministers of 5 states in attendance. Over the two-day deliberations, the alliance discussed major electoral issues for the upcoming general elections, carved out the coordination committee, and passed a three-point resolution to fight 2024 Indian general elections together 'as far as possible'.\n",
      "The fourth meeting was held in New Delhi on 19 December. The meeting was primarily held to discuss seat-sharing, joint rallies, and the prime ministerial face and/or convenor of the alliance. The alliance adopted a resolution to ensure maximum use of VVPATs in upcoming elections. \"To enhance confidence in elections, VVPAT slips should be directly given to voters to self-verify and place in a separate box, instead of them falling into the main box. Eventually, all VVPAT slips must be 100% counted, ensuring truly free and fair elections,\" read the resolution passed by the alliance at the meeting. Seat sharing was also to be done by either 31 December 2023 or mid-January 2024. It was also decided that protests will be held across the country on 22 December 2023 against the suspensions of opposition MPs in the Indian Parliament. Some leaders said that the alliance would hold a grand joint rally at Patna on 30 January 2024, the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, although this was not officially announced.\n",
